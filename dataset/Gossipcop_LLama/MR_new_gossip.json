        "article": "the two - part true - crime series on the jonbenet ramsey case has concluded with a shocking twist. according to a panel of experts, the killer was none other than jonbenet's brother, burke. the series, which aired on cbs, delved into the mysterious death of the 6 - year - old beauty pageant winner. the experts, including former fbi agents and forensic psychologists, concluded that burke, who was already a suspect in the case, was the one who killed jonbenet in the kitchen with a flashlight. the investigation was reignited in 2013 when a new dna sample was taken from the crime scene. using advanced technology, the experts were able to match the dna to burke, who was initially arrested but later released due to lack of evidence. however, the experts in the tv series presented a strong case against burke, based on the evidence collected over the years. they pointed out that the flashlight found near the body was found near burke's room, and that the dna sample collected from the flashlight matched burke's dna. the experts also noted that burke had a history of anger and frustration towards jonbenet, and that he had access to the kitchen where the crime was committed. the conclusion of the experts has not been met with enthusiasm from the public, with many people on twitter expressing skepticism about the theory. however, it is important to note that the experts'conclusion is based on the evidence collected so far and is not conclusive. the case of jonbenet ramsey remains one of the most shocking and baffling in american history, and the experts'conclusion is sure to be a topic of ongoing discussion and debate."

        "article": "the popular television show, the bachelorette, has been a guilty pleasure for many viewers for years. however, in recent seasons, the show has failed to deliver the excitement and drama that it once was known for. many fans have expressed their disappointment with the show, and now it ’ s time to ask if it ’ s time to say goodbye. one reason why the bachelorette just isn ’ t fun anymore is that the show has become too predictable. the format of the show has remained largely the same for years, and the twists and surprises have become few and far between. this has made it difficult for viewers to keep engaged and interested in the show. another reason why the bachelorette is no longer enjoyable is that the cast has become too diverse and unrepresentative of the general population. the show once pride itself on featuring a range of backgrounds and cultures, but now it seems like the only diverse voices are those of the contestants. this has made it difficult for viewers to relate to the show and its characters. additionally, the show ’ s focus on drama and conflict has become overwhelming. the relationships between the contestants are often presented in a exaggerated and melodramatic manner, which has made it difficult to take the show seriously. the constant fighting and drama among the contestants has also become too predictable and formulaic. furthermore, the show ’ s lack of representation of different relationship models and dynamics also contributes to its decreasing appeal. the show used to showcase a range of relationship types, but now it seems like the only ones that are given attention are the most dramatic and confrontational. this has made it difficult for viewers to learn about and appreciate different ways of forming and maintaining relationships. in conclusion, the bachelorette used to be a guilty pleasure for many viewers, but now it just feels guilty. the show has become too predictable, the cast has become too diverse, the focus on drama has become overwhelming, and the show ’ s lack of representation of different relationship models and dynamics has made it difficult to enjoy. it may be time to say goodbye to this show once and for all."

        "article": "mascara is a staple product in almost every makeup bag, but many of us make mistakes when using it that can lead to less than desirable results. beauty experts have shared some common mascara mistakes that we should be aware of to achieve the best results. 1. not using a clean brush : before applying mascara, it's essential to use a clean brush to remove any dirt or oil from the mascara wand. if you apply mascara on a dirty brush, it can result in clumpy or uneven application. 2. applying too much mascara : applying too much mascara can make the eyes look tired and clogged. to avoid this, start with a small amount and build up the application gradually. 3. wiping off too much : mascara can be tempting to wipe off completely after applying it. however, this can cause the mascara to smudge and look uneven. instead, try to let it dry first and then gently remove any excess with a clean brush. 4. using the wrong brush : different brushes are suitable for different makeup looks. if you're using a brush that's too dry or too wet, it can affect the application of mascara. 5. applying mascara in the wrong order : mascara should be applied after concealer and before powder. if you apply it in the wrong order, it can result in a messy look. 6. smudging mascara : mascara can smudge easily, especially if you use a harsh eye shadow or a color that's too dark. to avoid this, use a light - colored eyeshadow or a mascara that's designed not to smudge. 7. rubbing off mascara : mascara can sometimes be tempting to rub off completely if it's not applying properly. however, this can cause the mascara to transfer to your clothing or leave behind a residue on your face. 8. not blending : blending mascara is essential to achieve a natural look. try blending your mascara with a brush or a sponge to ensure that it's fully blended. by avoiding these common mascara mistakes, you can achieve a more natural and flawless look. remember to start with a small amount of mascara and build up the application gradually. and always use a clean brush before applying mascara."
