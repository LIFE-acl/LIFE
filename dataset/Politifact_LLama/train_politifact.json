Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest.

        "article": "The Pain Caucus, a group advocating for policies that prioritize creditor interests, continues to dominate economic decision-making in the face of changing justifications for imposing austerity measures. Despite different reasons being cited for inflicting pain, the Pain Caucus consistently backs policies that protect the wealthy bondholders at any cost.\n\nFor instance, while deficit spending could potentially create employment opportunities, it threatens the interests of existing bondholders. Even Republican economists have admitted that a modest level of inflation might be beneficial in reviving the economy. However, deflation, rather than inflation, aligns with the interests of creditors. Moreover, any form of debt relief is vehemently opposed, further emphasizing the prioritization of creditors' interests.\n\nDisturbingly, these creditors are not hardworking small business owners or workers, although it is in the best interest of powerful players to frame the agenda as protecting the little guy. The truth is that both small businesses and workers suffer more from the lingering weak economy than from measures like modest inflation, which could aid recovery.\n\nInstead, the primary beneficiaries of the Pain Caucus policies are the rentiers: influential bankers and affluent individuals heavily invested in bond portfolios. This explains their outsized influence on policy decisions. Not only do they contribute significantly to campaign funds, but they also enjoy personal connections with policy makers who often find lucrative positions within the financial industry after leaving government. The corrosive effect of this influence goes beyond mere corruption; it is perpetuated by an inherent bias towards assuming that what benefits the elite and affluent must inherently benefit the wider economy.\n\nIn reality, however, these creditor-friendly policies are severely crippling the economy. This approach operates on a zero-sum basis, where attempts to shield the rentiers from any losses result in much larger losses for everyone else. To achieve a genuine recovery, it is imperative to abandon this damaging game and pursue alternative strategies that promote a more inclusive and robust economy.",

        "article": "Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points, resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.\n\nClinton, the heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, currently leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters. Although within the poll's margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points, this represents a significant decrease from April when Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump. She had consistently led him by double digits since December.\n\nIn a hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.\n\nAnalyzing the numbers of the race between Clinton and Trump, Clinton holds the edge among certain demographics. She leads among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent), and those aged 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).\n\nConversely, Trump maintains a lead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent), and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll, conducted from May 15-19, comes at a time when Trump has become the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee. Additionally, the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become increasingly contentious in recent days.\n\nThe poll indicates that Republicans are now rallying behind Trump over Clinton, with an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin. This demonstrates a consolidation of GOP voters around their presumptive nominee, as compared to a month ago when it was 72 percent to 13 percent.\n\nDemocrats continue to support Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent margin. However, only 66 percent of Democratic primary voters who prefer Sanders are currently supporting Clinton against Trump, highlighting the challenge Clinton will face in winning over Sanders voters after the Democratic primary contest concludes.\n\nBoth Trump and Clinton currently have the highest unfavorable ratings in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll. Clinton's positive opinion among registered voters is at 34 percent, while 54 percent hold a negative view. Trump's ratings are even worse, with 29 percent having a positive view and 58 percent holding a negative view.\n\nBy contrast, Sanders maintains positive territory with 43 percent having a positive view of him, and 36 percent having a negative view. Notably, Clinton's rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is 38 percent positive and 41 percent negative, while Sanders' rating among Clinton supporters is 54 percent positive and 23 percent negative.\n\nPresident Obama currently holds a 49 percent positive rating and a 41 percent negative rating.\n\nWhen asked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, 47 percent of registered voters say yes, higher than the percentages reported in 2008 and 2012. Fifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate.\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll was conducted from May 15-19 and included 1,000 registered voters. The survey had a margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.",

        "title": "In his inaugural remarks in January 1937, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked out at the nation and saw the dire circumstances faced by its citizens. He witnessed families struggling to make ends meet, individuals lacking access to education and basic necessities, and poverty running rampant. In response to these hardships, Roosevelt implemented various programs that put people back to work, alleviated poverty, and restored faith in the government. Many of these programs, such as Social Security and the minimum wage, were labeled as socialist at the time. However, they have since become integral components of the American welfare system and contributed to the growth of the middle class.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and while the United States is better off economically, there are still millions of families struggling to survive and make ends meet. The middle class has dwindled over the past four decades, and faith in the political system is at an all-time low. A small portion of the population continues to amass vast amounts of wealth, while the majority struggle to keep up.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders believes that it is time for a change. He argues that the United States needs a political movement that challenges the ruling elite and fights for the rights and needs of working families. Democratic socialism, as Sanders defines it, aims to create an economy that benefits everyone, not just the wealthy. It calls for a political system that works for all Americans, not just a select few. Sanders believes in a government that guarantees economic security for all citizens, where everyone has access to healthcare, education, and a decent standard of living. He advocates for policies such as a $15 minimum wage, Medicare for all, tuition-free public colleges, and reforms to combat income inequality and campaign finance corruption.\n\nSanders emphasizes the importance of a vibrant democracy where every citizen has the right to vote and participate in the political process. He criticizes the low voter turnout in the United States and the corrupt campaign finance system that allows wealthy individuals and corporations to exert undue influence. Sanders proposes overturning the landmark Citizens United decision and implementing public funding of elections.\n\nFurthermore, Sanders highlights the need for a strong coalition, including Muslim nations and countries like Russia, to combat the global threat of terrorism. He calls for a collective effort to destroy ISIS, with Muslim nations leading the fight and receiving support from the United States and other major powers. Sanders also urges countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar, to take more responsibility in the fight against terrorism.\n\nIn conclusion, Senator Bernie Sanders believes that democratic socialism is the way forward for the United States. He envisions an America where economic security is a right, everyone has access to affordable healthcare and education, and the political system is free from corruption. Sanders advocates for a coalition of nations to combat terrorism and emphasizes the need for greater involvement from Muslim countries in the fight against ISIS. Overall, he aims to create a society that works for all Americans, not just a privileged few.",

        "article": "Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. \"We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,\" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.@solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016@solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.This is exactly how fake news spreadsBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.",

Photo: Joe Garofoli, San Francisco Chronicle The pro-Russia, pro-weed, pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beat 1 / 4 Back to GalleryCOSTA MESA, Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10.Then again, Ronald Reagan’s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. He’s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “Putin pays” him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “a total hoax.”He’s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops.” During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “Individual Man.”If you’re a Democrat, you’re thinking, “How is this guy still holding office in California?”Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. They’re focused on districts like Rohrabacher’s, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch.It won’t be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin’-the-Gipper part of the OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times, and he’s won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but he’s conservative OC kind of fringe-y.That’s why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he’s “not worried about Dana at all.” And it doesn’t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District.Still, Rohrabacher acknowledges, “this race will be the toughest.” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, “of Russia.”Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the “high confidence” with which the nation’s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election?“Total bull—,” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen. “I’ve read those reports and they’re full of weasel words.”“That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election,” he said.One of Rohrabacher’s sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England.Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn’t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didn’t say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpa’s neighborhood.Rohrabacher isn’t buying that conspiracy theory, but he’s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said.“It’s all baloney,” Rohrabacher said.Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former “Hillary and Bernie supporter” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.“It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,” Rohrabacher said. “It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation” and to “put our president on the spot.”Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of “Info Wars,” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is “Pants on Fire” groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact.Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC.Plus, there’s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabacher’s office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way.“People saw ‘incumbent’ and an ‘R’ by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values,” said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. “Dana Rohrabacher doesn’t support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me ‘We didn’t realize he was this unhinged.’”Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets.But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone.And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he’s rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. He’s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he’s raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.Joe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle’s senior political writer.

Consequently, when the labor market experiences a decline, it directly impacts household income.\n\nAccording to recent figures, the income for the median working-age household, where the householder is under 65, witnessed a significant drop of $4,184 between 2007 and 2010. This decline occurred in the wake of one of the worst business cycles (2000-2007) in terms of job creation. During this period, the income of the median working-age household had already fallen by $2,113.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these events suggests that in 2010, the typical working-age household earned approximately $6,300 less compared to the income it generated in 2000.

He emphasized that the American Dream of hard work leading to success was slipping away for many people and called for renewed efforts to rebuild the economy.\n\nPresident Obama outlined his American Jobs Act, a comprehensive jobs bill aimed at creating more employment opportunities and putting more money in the pockets of working families. The bill received bipartisan support and was backed by independent economists who projected it could create up to 2 million jobs and boost the economy by as much as 2 percent.\n\nHowever, the President expressed disappointment in the Senate's refusal to debate the bill and the lack of support from Republicans. He called on Congress to reconsider and vote in favor of the American Jobs Act, specifically highlighting the need to extend tax cuts for middle-class families.\n\nThe President stressed the importance of extending the payroll tax cut, set to expire at the end of the year. He explained that failing to extend this tax cut would result in a $1,000 increase in taxes for the average middle-class family, which would also have a detrimental impact on the economy as it continues to recover from the recession.\n\nPresident Obama urged Congress to prioritize the needs of working families over protecting tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. He reiterated his belief in the collective responsibility Americans have in supporting and uplifting one another. Asking the wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share, he argued, would help create a more balanced and prosperous society.\n\nThe President called on the American people to voice their support for the extension of tax cuts to their senators, emphasizing the power of individual voices in shaping government actions. He urged Congress to put partisanship aside and work together to pass the American Jobs Act, emphasizing that America's best days lie ahead when its citizens unite in pursuit of progress.\n\nPresident Obama concluded his speech by reminding the audience that America has always risen to the occasion during challenging times and expressed his confidence in the resilience and determination of the American people.",

        "article": "During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.",

        "title": "Donald Trump, Billy Bush: Interview Scrambles Race",
        "article": "The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.\n\nBut not even John Podesta’s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump from the lashing that was coming his way.\n\nRepublicans lined up to criticize Trump’s language and attitudes toward women. His advisors worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisors urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump’s Sunday night debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.\n\nTrump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans’ freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. “These words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,” Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.\n\nThen, against allies’ advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s marriage. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,” Trump said.\n\nIt wasn’t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. “Donald Trump needs to humble himself,” Trump advisor Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States utter some of Trump’s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. “There have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,” Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: “How does any woman work for Donald Trump?”\n\nIt made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America’s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department’s release of more of Clinton’s own emails from her time as the nation’s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump’s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.\n\nAs Trump’s candidacy appeared—yet again—to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta’s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton’s emails, which he called an “October Surprise” on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump’s words, however. “Women have the power to stop Trump,” Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.\n\nIn an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events—and the responses—would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say “When you’re a star, they let you do it” hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.\n\n“He is talking about sexual assault. There’s no other way to frame this,” Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.\n\nFor Clinton, her top aide’s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches—a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton’s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn’t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa’s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? “Clinton admits she is out of touch,” “Clinton suggests she is a moderate” and “Clinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.”\n\nAnother potential pickle is this headline: “Clinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.” Republicans are obsessed with Clinton’s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump’s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.\n\nYet, as a whole, Trump’s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call “locker-room banter” laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women’s appearance in crass terms, and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that “such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world.” Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois called Trump “a malignant clown.” Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks “totally inappropriate and offensive.” Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said “America deserves far better” than Trump. Trump’s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination, Jeb Bush, said “no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.”\n\nTrump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump’s video. “They did their opposition research. This is what they had,” former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. “She has to change the narrative.” Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump’s supporters firmly in their camp. “A 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of concerns,” he said.\n\nThat thinking might help some of Trump’s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman’s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.\n\nBut there’s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night’s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.",

        "article": "James Fields, from Ohio, arrested following attack at ‘Unite the Right’ gathering, and two police officers die in helicopter crashA man has been arrested and charged with murder after a car rammed into a group of people peacefully protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one person and injuring 19.Police said a 32-year-old woman had died and that they were attempting to notify her family before releasing more details.Col Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville regional jail, told the Guardian that 20-year-old James Fields, of Ohio, had been arrested following the attack on Saturday.Facebook Twitter Pinterest James Fields was charged with second-degree murder. Photograph: Albemarle County Jail/AFP/Getty Images“He has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,” Kumer said in an email.Donald Trump condemned the “violence on many sides”, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville.State police said in a statement the helicopter was “assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation” when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – videoCharlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read moreThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.”Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will – go home.”Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: “Go home … Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.NBC News (@NBCNews) WATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally https://t.co/4qH1yJjrGyThe car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said: “We’re here to counteract white supremacy, and to let people know that it is a system of evil and a system of sin.”Steve Thomas, from Lynchburg, Virginia, who also protested against the far-right groups, said: “I think that what we are witnessing here has always been simmering beneath the surface, and now has been emboldened and enabled by the Trump administration’s politics and rhetoric.”Statue controversyIn February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.It was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by about 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan’s departure, and made 23 arrests.Ben Jacobs and the Associated Press contributed to this report",

The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back.

The way to do this is not by banning it all at once, but instead by monitoring use and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke, offering ways to help people quit, warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.If you like this blog don't forget to share it.You are currently reading about Smoking In Cars With Children Is Illegal Starting January 30, 2018.

        "article": "In a Republican presidential debate in January 2016, Donald Trump criticized China for not doing enough to rein in North Korea. He claimed that China has \"total control - just about\" over the secretive nation. However, experts on the region have provided a more nuanced answer. While China does have influence over North Korea due to its role in trade, this influence falls short of \"total control.\"\n\nChina's role in trade, particularly food and fuel, gives it significant leverage over North Korea. It accounts for a large portion of North Korea's trade and investment flows. Cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so could present economic problems for North Korea. However, experts say that China is reluctant to fully exercise its leverage due to concerns of a potential humanitarian disaster or an outflow of refugees on its border.\n\nDespite China's economic influence, North Korea has demonstrated a disregard for outside pressure. The country has ignored the United Nations and world powers, and its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. North Korea prides itself on its self-reliance and answering to no one.\n\nFurthermore, North Korea's development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China. China's public and private exhortations for North Korea to not test nuclear weapons and missiles have gone unheeded. Relations between the two countries have become strained, with Chinese President Xi Jinping not meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nDonald Trump's claim of China having \"total control, just about\" over North Korea oversimplifies the complexities of their relationship. While China does hold significant leverage, North Korea's independence and recent actions suggest that China lacks the level of control Trump suggests.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's statement contains an element of truth regarding China's leverage over North Korea but neglects critical factors that limit this control. Therefore, we rate his claim as Mostly False.",
