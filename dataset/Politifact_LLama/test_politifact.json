        "article": "A recent discovery has raised concerns among users regarding the privacy practices of popular news outlet POLITICO. By signing up on the website, users unknowingly grant POLITICO the permission to collect and utilize their personal data for various purposes.\n\nThe agreement, hidden within the terms of service and privacy policy, allows POLITICO to collect user information in order to tailor content recommendations, send email newsletters, and provide updates – all without explicit consent. Moreover, the aggregated user data may also be shared with third-party entities for undisclosed purposes.\n\nThis revelation has sparked outrage among privacy advocates, who argue that user data should not be exploited without transparent consent. Critics claim that the privacy policy should explicitly state the extent of data collection and provide users with more control over their personal information.\n\nMany users remain unaware of the implications of their agreement, as the language is buried in complicated legal jargon. This not only raises questions about the ethics of data collection, but also highlights the need for clearer and more user-friendly privacy policies.\n\nIn response to the concerns, POLITICO asserts that users can unsubscribe at any time and provides contact information for further inquiries. However, critics argue that such an invasive data collection practice should not be the default, but rather an opt-in choice.\n\nThis incident also emphasizes the importance of understanding the privacy policies of any website or platform before providing personal information. Users are urged to read agreements thoroughly and consider the potential implications of sharing their data.\n\nAs the debate surrounding user privacy intensifies, it is evident that stricter regulations and more transparent practices are needed to ensure individuals' data is handled responsibly in the digital age.",

In a recent press conference, the private investigator stated that Rich had made contact with WikiLeaks before his untimely death, suggesting that his murder may have been related to his involvement in a potential leak of confidential information.\n\nThe private investigator, who remains anonymous, disclosed that he had conducted his own independent forensic investigation and had come across a number of emails and other electronic communications, which allegedly mentioned Rich's involvement with WikiLeaks. These communications were unearthed from a personal laptop belonging to Rich, which he kept in his apartment.\n\nAccording to the private investigator's findings, Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks at least two weeks before he was shot and killed in July 2016. Furthermore, the emails suggested that Rich was actively working with WikiLeaks to leak confidential information from the DNC.\n\nThe private investigator did not comment on the source of his evidence, nor did he elaborate on the specifics of the information that Rich had allegedly intended to leak to WikiLeaks. Nevertheless, conspiracy theories surrounding Rich's murder have been rampant since his death last year, with many speculating that his death was politically motivated.\n\nThe FBI, which is currently investigating the murder, has declined to comment on the private investigator's claims.\n\nThe release of this new evidence is sure to reignite speculation and debate surrounding Rich's murder and the potential link to WikiLeaks. Many questions remain unanswered, but for now, the alleged connection between Rich and WikiLeaks may prove to be a pivotal piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation into his death.",

        "article": "The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot.\n\nThe outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.\n\nThe images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\n\nGlenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:\n\n\"Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They're supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It's the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.\"\n\nThe Cato Institute's Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:\n\n\"Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? ('This my property!' he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that 'We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone'?\"\n\nOlson added, \"the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.\"\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nMost police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.\n\nThere is a systemic problem with today's law enforcement.\n\nNot surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most Americans think of as law enforcement.\n\nThis is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation's Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, \"the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.\"\n\nBernick continued, \"federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.\"\n\nBernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, \"today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.\"\n\nWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.\n\nGiven these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\n\nThis is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.\n\nAnyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.\n\nThe militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.\n\nAmericans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.\n\nLet us continue to pray for Michael Brown's family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.\n\nPaul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.",

        "article": "President Donald Trump’s recent rhetoric on implementing stricter taxes for hedge funds may not align with his actual plan, raising concerns about the effectiveness of his proposed measures.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign and even after taking office, Trump repeatedly criticized the hedge-fund industry, claiming that it exploits tax loopholes and benefits from preferential treatment. He vowed to close these loopholes and make hedge funds pay their fair share of taxes.\n\nHowever, a closer analysis of Trump's tax plan reveals a different story. Rather than cracking down on hedge-fund tax practices, his proposed reforms primarily focus on lowering corporate tax rates and providing relief for high-income individuals. This discrepancy begs the question: is Trump's tough talk on hedge-fund taxes nothing more than political posturing?\n\nWhile the proposed reforms might have positive impacts on the overall economy, critics argue that they do not address the specific issues surrounding hedge-fund taxation. The lack of specific measures targeting this industry raises doubts about Trump's commitment to tackling the concerns he previously expressed.\n\nHedge funds are known for utilizing complex strategies to minimize their tax obligations legally. Critics argue that these practices allow hedge-fund managers to pay lower effective tax rates compared to many middle-class Americans. This income inequality has fueled public anger and calls for reform.\n\nThe tension between Trump's tough rhetoric and his actual plan is further amplified by the presence of former hedge-fund managers within his administration. Critics argue that influential figures from the industry, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, may influence policy decisions in favor of their former colleagues instead of implementing reforms.\n\nAs the President continues to push for his ambitious tax reforms, it remains to be seen whether he will truly address the concerns surrounding hedge-fund taxes. Trump's tough talk may have garnered attention, but its alignment with his actual plan is still questionable.\n\nA comprehensive and fair tax system requires a diligent and genuine effort to close any loopholes that allow certain industries to disproportionately benefit. Only time will tell if the President's words will translate into meaningful action or if his tough talk on hedge-fund taxes is merely political rhetoric aimed at appeasing the public.",

        "article": "In a candid interview in the Oval Office with AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace, President Donald Trump discussed a range of topics, including his first 100 days in office, the release of American charity worker Aya Hijazi, his relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and his plans for tax reform and the renegotiation of NAFTA. Here are the key highlights from the interview:\n\nRelease of Aya Hijazi:\nPresident Trump revealed that he had asked the Egyptian government to release Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in Egypt for nearly three years. He stated that he did not strike any deal with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, but simply asked him to look into the case. President Trump also noted that the release of Hijazi and seven other individuals was a “great thing to see.\"\n\nRelationship with Angela Merkel:\nPresident Trump spoke highly of his relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, stating that they had \"unbelievable chemistry\" despite their disagreements on NATO payments and immigration. He discussed an incident in which he had reportedly ignored calls to shake Merkel's hand, stating that he had already shaken her hand four times during their meeting. He emphasized that he had developed great relationships with all world leaders, including el-Sissi.\n\nPerceptions of the Presidency:\nPresident Trump dismissed the significance of the 100-day benchmark, stating that it was an \"artificial barrier\" that does not hold much meaning. He expressed confidence in the relationships he has established with world leaders and claimed that he should be given high marks for this achievement. According to the President, his interactions with world leaders, particularly his dealings with China, have been positively received, despite criticisms over his approach to NATO and his push for member countries to increase their contributions.\n\nTax Reform and Obamacare:\nPresident Trump revealed that his administration would be announcing its tax reform plan on Wednesday, aiming to unveil a comprehensive plan for both businesses and individuals. He compared his efforts on healthcare to those of former President Obama, stating that he had been working on healthcare for 60 days, whereas Obama had taken 17 months to pass the Affordable Care Act. He emphasized that his administration is laying the foundation for future policy accomplishments.\n\nBorder Wall and NAFTA:\nRegarding the border wall with Mexico, President Trump stated that it would be built, either through renegotiation or termination of NAFTA. He indicated that the cost of the wall would be significantly less than the estimated $24 billion, and that he hoped to have it built for $10 billion or less. President Trump also mentioned his administration's goal to crack down on criminal gangs, particularly MS-13, and secure the border to prevent drug trafficking.\n\nIran Nuclear Deal:\nPresident Trump accused Iran of breaking the \"spirit\" of the nuclear accord by engaging in destabilizing activities in the Middle East. While he did not explicitly state that the U.S. would withdraw from the deal, he noted that it was a possibility. He declined to comment on discussions with European leaders regarding the agreement.\n\nDreamers and Immigration:\nIn response to a question about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and Dreamers, President Trump stated that his administration's policy is to focus on capturing and deporting criminals, rather than targeting the Dreamers. He assured that Dreamers should \"rest easy\" and that there are no immediate plans to change their status.\n\nThe interview with President Trump covered a wide range of topics, providing insight into his thoughts on foreign policy, immigration, and his first 100 days in office. The President discussed his accomplishments, highlighted his priorities, and emphasized the importance of relationships with world leaders in achieving his goals.",

        "article": "With the unthinkable now cautiously possible, peace between North and South Korea, speculation about President Donald Trump becoming a Nobel Peace Prize winner has begun. If peace in the Korean Peninsula truly happens, the Nobel committee could be left with a difficult choice regarding Trump’s candidacy.Recognizing those who helped bring peace to the region would seem like an easy choice, but a decision to give Trump the award could force the Nobel Prize committee into a fierce political debate on whether a man who has openly mocked foreign leaders, launched multiple airstrikes and has threatened war, deserves an award for peace.But, if the reconciliation happens, how could Trump’s apparent achievement not be recognized? Donald Trump Jr. said regardless of what unfolds, his father won’t get the credit. “Remember who decides this stuff,” he tweeted. “... The globalist elite would never give him that win.”Getty ImagesIt’s not just Trump. He and Kim Jong Un could both claim the award this year, Trump aides and an oddsmaker from Britain said, according to New York Magazine.Trump has taken a hard foreign policy stance with North Korea since he took office. With “rocket man” quips and threatening words of military strength, peace with the North Korea Leader appeared a lost cause. But fast forward to April 2018, and Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are shaking hands at the Military Demarcation Line, signing the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula and formally ending the Korean war.After the apparently successful meeting between the Korean leaders Trump is now scheduled to meet with the North Korean leader soon, with a location yet to be determined.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now“I will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks, we look forward to that,\" Trump said during a Friday press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"We're down to two countries as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is.\"If that meeting and Friday’s summit leads to a peace accord, GOP leaders are saying a Nobel Prize would be warranted. Senator Lindsey Graham and former Trump administration official Carl Higbie have already voiced their support for him to win the award.“We’re not there yet, but if this happens, President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,” Graham said on Friday on Fox & Friends.Laura Ingraham tweeted her support for him to win the award on Friday.“When will we see the headline: “Trump Ends the Korean War”? Unlike Obama, he actually deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Ingraham said.If Trump were to win the Nobel Peace Prize, he would not be the first controversial winner. Le Duc Tho became the first and only person to voluntarily refuse a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in negotiating a ceasefire on Vietnam with U.S. Secretary of the State Henry Kissinger. Despite Kissinger’s acceptance of the award, Tho refused to accept because “peace has not been really restored in South Vietnam.”“When the Paris agreement on Vietnam is respected, guns are silenced, and peace is really restored in South Vietnam, I will consider the acceptance of this prize,” he said.Other controversial candidates who have won the award include German journalist Carl Von Ossietzky, who was awarded the prize in 1935 after publishing secret details about the German remilitarization in breach of the Treaty of Versailles before World War II began. The Nazi Party put pressure on the Norwegian Nobel Committee to not grant the award to Ossietzky in 1934, but the committee eventually gave him the award the following year. His win caused two members of the committee to quit, saying they did not want to get involved with what was going on in Germany at the time.Former President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was another controversial win. The Obama administration said it was embarrassing to win the prestigious award his first year in office. The committee said Obama won because of “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"The first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Wangari Maathai, also had controversy surrounding her selection. Maathai was granted the award for her efforts to empower women living in rural areas in Kenya to reverse deforestation. Her win, however, was slammed by many because of remarks she allegedly made in a Kenyan newspaper, saying that HIV/AIDS were created by Western scientists to try to depopulate Africa.There are currently 329 candidates for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, according to the organization’s website. The winners will be announced on December 10.",

The controversial legislation is an attempt to put an end to the supposed confusion over gender and sexuality that has resulted from the acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community and the proposed new federal government laws seeking to protect their rights. \n\nThe proposal, which Cole argues is necessary for safety reasons, states that all students must undergo a physical examination by a qualified medical professional to determine their biological sex and the corresponding restroom they are allowed to use. Any student who refuses to comply will be denied access to restroom facilities. \n\nCommentators have denounced the proposal as an egregious invasion of privacy and an attempt to enforce archaic and discriminatory social norms. Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David denounced the legislation, saying, “This is nothing short of state-sanctioned discrimination, and it is deeply troubling that this type of harmful legislation is even being considered.” \n\nThe bill has sparked mass protests and demonstrations across Virginia. Activists argue that the legislation is a violation of the human rights of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals and exposes them to harassment and humiliation. Cole has refused to back down from his proposal, however, saying that he will do whatever it takes to ensure the safety and well-being of all students. \n\nThe proposal is expected to be met with fierce opposition in the state legislature and is unlikely to pass. However, the fact that a sitting representative of the Republican Party would propose such a law has sent shockwaves across the country and underscores the need for greater protection of the rights of marginalized communities.",

        "title": "Executive Order: Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States",
        "article": "President Donald J. Trump has issued a new executive order titled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.\" This order aims to strengthen the visa-issuance process and increase security measures to prevent foreign nationals with terrorist ties from entering the United States. The President emphasizes the importance of protecting American citizens and ensuring that those admitted to the country do not pose a threat or harbor anti-American sentiments.\n\nThe executive order highlights the need to review and enhance the visa-issuance process, considering the lessons learned from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The State Department's policies at that time failed to scrutinize the visa applications of several foreign nationals involved in the attacks, leading to the tragedy. Despite subsequent improvements to the process, the order acknowledges that these measures have not been entirely effective in preventing attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.\n\nThe order states that various individuals with ties to terrorism have been implicated in crimes within the United States, including those who entered the country through visitor, student, or employment visas, as well as those who came via the refugee resettlement program. The deteriorating conditions in certain countries have increased the risk of terrorists exploiting the immigration system to gain entry into the United States. The order asserts the need for vigilance during the visa-issuance process to ensure that approved individuals do not have any intentions to harm Americans and are not associated with terrorism.\n\nThe President emphasizes that the United States should not admit individuals who do not support the Constitution or prioritize violent ideologies over American law. Additionally, those who perpetrate acts of bigotry, hatred, violence against women, or religious persecution should not be granted entry. The country should not tolerate the oppression of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nThe executive order establishes policies to protect American citizens from foreign nationals intending to commit terrorist attacks within the United States. It also aims to prevent the exploitation of U.S. immigration laws for malicious purposes.\n\nThe order calls for a review by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to determine the necessary information for the visa adjudication process in order to verify the identity and detect potential security threats. The results of this review, including the countries that do not provide adequate information, will be submitted to the President within 30 days.\n\nTo minimize investigative burdens and enhance screening capabilities, the order implements a temporary suspension of immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States from countries listed in section 217(a)(12) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This suspension will last for 90 days, with exceptions for individuals traveling on certain diplomatic visas.\n\nThe order also directs the Secretary of State to request foreign governments that do not supply necessary information for adjudications to start providing such information within 60 days. After the 60-day period, a list of countries recommended for entry prohibition will be submitted to the President.\n\nThe Secretaries of State and Homeland Security are required to provide periodic reports to the President on the progress of implementing this order, and the Secretaries may recommend additional countries for similar treatment.\n\nThe order further emphasizes the implementation of uniform screening standards for all immigration programs. This includes the development of a uniform screening procedure, in-person interviews, identity document verification, and a mechanism to determine the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positive contributor to society.\n\nIn relation to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the order suspends the program for 120 days to allow for a review of the application and adjudication process. Additional procedures will be implemented to ensure the admission of refugees only if they do not pose a threat to national security. Priority will be given to refugees fleeing religious-based persecution, particularly if their religion is a minority in their country of nationality.\n\nThe Secretary of State is directed to provide reports on the progress of these changes within specific time frames. The resumption of USRAP admissions will only occur for nationals from countries deemed to have adequate procedures in place to ensure security and welfare.\n\nOther provisions of the order include the rescinding of exercises of authority related to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, expedited completion of a biometric entry-exit tracking system, suspension of the Visa Interview Waiver Program, review of visa validity reciprocity agreements, and the enhancement of transparency and data collection related to terrorism-related offenses and gender-based violence.\n\nThis executive order, consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, aims to safeguard American citizens from the threat of terrorism and ensure a secure and orderly immigration system that prioritizes the interests of the United States.",

        "article": "2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivered a powerful speech at the National Urban League Conference, focusing on key issues such as jobs, the economy, and the recent wave of police killings and the tragic shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn her remarks, Clinton highlighted the importance of creating more job opportunities for all Americans, especially minority communities that have been disproportionately affected by unemployment. She emphasized her commitment to expanding affordable childcare, raising the minimum wage, and ensuring equal pay for women, stating that these measures would not only provide immediate relief for struggling families but also help foster long-term economic growth.\n\nDiscussing the state of the economy, Clinton expressed concerns over the increasing income inequality and the need for fair policies that benefit all Americans. She proposed policies that will shift the tax burden from the middle class to the wealthiest individuals and corporations, in order to support investments in education, infrastructure, and innovation. Clinton reiterated her pledge to fight for economic fairness and create an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.\n\nAddressing the recent tragic incidents of police violence and the Charleston church shooting, Clinton condemned these acts as not only attacks on innocent lives but also attacks on the fundamental values of equality and justice. She expressed her support for criminal justice reforms to address systemic racism and restore trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Clinton also emphasized the importance of strengthening gun control measures to prevent future tragedies and protect American citizens.\n\nThroughout her speech, Clinton reaffirmed her commitment to improving the lives of all Americans and emphasized the need for unity and inclusivity. Recognizing the challenges faced by urban communities, she pledged to work closely with organizations like the National Urban League to address these issues and uplift those most in need.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race continues, Clinton's speech at the National Urban League Conference provided insight into her priorities and positions on key issues affecting the urban community.

        "article": "Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",

Moore has been hated passionately by the left for decades, for his consistent dedication to biblical morality.Consider how suspicious this is – a woman comes forward 39 years later with a vicious never-before-made accusation – and how is one suppose to defend oneself and prove it is a lie 39 years later? Welcome to politics in America.The establishment doesn’t want Roy Moore, a man who can’t be bought or bribed, to pull up their political skirts and overturn their tables of corruption and greed! Roy Moore will win big!

We’ve had people back home telling us they are getting phone calls and when they would tell them good things, the Washington Post would ask them if they knew anything bad on him.”Well, her story continues to be corroborated, as witnesses have come forward saying the Washington Post, a paper that has officially endorsed Jones, has actually been bribing people to dig up dirt on Moore!Go figure! This is exactly what Kayla claims has been happening.Roy Moore had this to say about the fabricated campaign against him:The Obama-Clinton Machine’s liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I’ve EVER faced!We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message. The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm –– if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.I believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values!Our nation is at a crossroads right now — both spiritually and politically.Our children and grandchildren’s futures are on the line.So rest assured — I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!The Democrats always pull this stunt. Ever since they saw it work for the Clintons they’ve been trying it every chance they get! But they completely underestimate Roy Moore and the people of God.This is a last-ditch, hail mary pass effort from the Democats to slander a man they’ve hated as long as he has held public office.

        "title": "JUDY WOODRUFF: We come back now to the gun story.\nAnd we're joined by David Keene. He's president of the National Rifle Association.\nWelcome to the NewsHour.\nDAVID KEENE, National Rifle Association: Thank you for having me.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said the critics who argue that what they're trying to do by limiting gun violence and say that it's an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He said, what we're simply doing are commonsense safety measures.\nDAVID KEENE: That's what Michael Bloomberg says.\nNo, it is an attack on the Second Amendment. It is an attack on those Americans who purchased and legally use firearms, who have never committed a criminal act, who have never done anything wrong. And they can say that it doesn't infringe upon their rights, but, in fact, it does.\nNow, every amendment -- the First Amendment -- you can't, famously, yell fire in a crowded theater. The Second Amendment is also subject to reasonable limits. The Supreme Court has held that. But they're strictly looked at. And you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that they're really necessary. And the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good. They're asking the question, Judy, what do we do about guns? The question should be, what do we do to prevent the kinds of things that happened in Connecticut?\nAnd we don't think that they're asking that question, but they're pursuing their own agenda.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say that's what they're doing.\nDAVID KEENE: I know they do.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And let me just quickly read from something that Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was gravely wounded. Mark Kelly, her husband. They wrote an op-ed article just a few days ago. They say, people who are just -- he said: \"Special interests have cast -- have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties.\"\nAnd they say, as a result, more people are vulnerable to gun violence.\nDAVID KEENE: You know, they're talking about what they call assault weapons. Actually, an assault weapon, so-called, wasn't involved in the Giffords shooting.\nBut the fact of the matter is that we have heard time and time again that these are military weapons designed for the battlefield. They're not. They're semiautomatic commercial rifles. The AR-15 is the bestselling long gun in the United States. There are over three million of them that have been purchased by people.\nMost people that have them use them for sport shooting, for hunting and for the like. And to take those guns away from them for no reason is an infringement on their rights.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, the mother of one of the victims in Aurora, Colo., was visiting Newtown just yesterday, and she specifically talked about the AR-15, these assault weapons.\nAnd she said, they don't belong in the hands of people in the community. What do you say to what -- her name is...\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... Phillips.\nDAVID KEENE: It was interesting, Judy, because...\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say to her?\nDAVID KEENE: ... because we're talking -- anybody who dies in a tragedy, whether it's an auto accident or beaten to death or knifed or killed by a gun, it is tragic. And I can understand her reaction to that.\nBut, in this country, last year, more people were, in fact, beaten to death than killed by all long arms, including assault, so-called assault weapons. The semiautomatic rifle has been in this country and available to people since 1806.\nIn our museum, we have got one that fired 20 rounds from a magazine, a magazine that would be banned by some people, that Lewis and Clark took with them on their expedition.\nIt's been that long. And we're talking -- we're talking about something that has no impact. We have tried to do that as a society before. It hasn't made any difference.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we can argue about the statistics. I mean, what is out there...\nDAVID KEENE: Right. People do that.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... 70 percent of the violent deaths last year were due -- had a gun involved.\nBut, specifically, David Keene, what about what we're hearing from the president, that there is going to be an attempt to ban the assault weapon, that there will be a proposal for comprehensive background checks? Is there -- where -- is there any common ground between the position of the NRA and the White House?\nDAVID KEENE: Yes, there is some common ground.\nIt's not on banning rifles that we don't think would make any difference. And it's not on setting up a national gun registry.\nBut we have for 20 years been asking that those people who have been adjudicated to be mentally potentially violent be put on the lists of people who are not allowed to buy firearms.\nWhen you go into a store to buy a gun, or if you go to a gun show to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they have to check your background. The FBI keeps databases of people who are not allowed to buy guns, felons, and the like. We have been urging that these people be put on these lists. And nothing has happened.\nTwenty-three states don't put any on the list. Now, one of the things we have to do is keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do that partly in that way. The problem is, you can never predict in a society who is going to do what.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\nDAVID KEENE: So, you also have to provide security. And that's what we have been proposing in terms of the schools.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And that's why -- and that's -- and you mentioned mental illness. And that is something the administration is going to talk about.\nMaybe there's some common ground there. When it comes to guards, putting armed guards, Gov. Markell said earlier on the program that -- he said, how would you know where to put a guard, how many to put? He said it's really an impractical thing to...\nDAVID KEENE: Sure.\nWell, I don't think that it's impractical. You know, just by coincidence, I was in Israel the day after the Newtown shooting. And I was touring a facility where they, in fact, train guards for their schools, because they had a spate of shootings in the 1970s.\nTheir crazy people are a little different from ours, but the results were the same. And they first used volunteers.\nNow each school provides its own through private security guards. And I was in a place where they train these people. It works there. It was a sensible thing for them to do.\nAfter Columbine, President Clinton proposed what he called the COPS program. And about 28,000 schools in this country now either have police through that program or police that are paid for by the state or private security guards. Those schools have them.\nNow, and it is -- there's an argument -- the argument against it is just what you said. But the fact is, if you look at the people who do this, first of all, they're mentally deranged. And, secondly, they're cowards. And the fact that there's somebody armed there will prevent them in most cases from doing anything.\nCan you -- do we live in a perfect world? No. But we can do what makes sense to protect our kids.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of what's not perfect, what about trying some of the solutions that the folks who are saying they're not trying to attack the Second Amendment are saying? They simply want to make -- they want to reduce gun violence.\nWhy not try reducing high-capacity ammunition clips? Why not try a ban on assault weapons?\nDAVID KEENE: Well, we tried a ban on assault weapons. The only thing that is different is -- and, remember, Judy, that an assault weapon has to be listed because there's no functional difference between a so-called assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle.\nSo, this time, they're saying, well, if it has a pistol grip, it's dangerous. If it doesn't have a pistol grip, it isn't dangerous. Now, that's absurd from a functional standpoint, because it's the same gun, the same rifle. And the only difference is cosmetic.\nSo, banning something for cosmetic reasons is not going to cause -- is not going to cure the problem.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not saying there's -- couldn't reasonable people sit down at the table and come up with a solution that would satisfy you, your organization and would satisfy those who say, we have got to make it safer?\nDAVID KEENE: That's why we went to the meeting with Vice President Biden.\nBut, you know, before that meeting, the vice president himself and those speaking for him said, we're open-minded. We're going to discuss this. We got to the meeting.\nAnd one of the first things he said was, the president and I have strong feelings about firearms, and nobody is going to change our mind on that. We're going to pursue what we want to pursue.\nFine. They had the meeting, so they could say, oh, and we talked to the NRA.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I happened to talk to someone in the White House, because I had heard you say something similar to that in another interview. And they say that's not what was said in the meeting.\nDAVID KEENE: Well, it is.\nAnd the other thing -- let me say one other thing. In the last year, 77,000 people who were on the prohibited list tried to buy firearms. That, in itself, is a crime. You know how many have been prosecuted? Seventy.\nWhen that was raised at the meeting, the attorney general said, well, we don't have the resources and the time to be going after those people. Those people are the potential criminals whom we're trying to keep guns out of the hands of, but the government doesn't have time to do anything about them. They do have time to try and prohibit legitimate citizens from owning firearms.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, David Keene, the new polls show that are out that show even in gun-owning households people are saying by large percentages we need to do something about, again, high-capacity ammunition clips, assault weapons, background checks?\nDAVID KEENE: Well, actually, interestingly, the Gallup poll showed no change at all on the so-called assault weapon question. I consider that evidence of the fact that people are smarter than politicians.\nBut given the publicity and everything, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more of an immediate reaction.\nBut when we get into this, when we begin to discuss it -- and remember it's sort of deja vu, because we have had this discussion before. Once the discussion takes place and people think about the substance of it, I'm confident that the judgment of the American people is going to be as it was before.\nAnd that is that Second Amendment rights should be protected. Criminals should be prosecuted. And we should strengthen the ways we keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business buying them.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: David Keene, president of the NRA, we thank you for being with us tonight.\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, as always. Thank you.",
        "article": "JUDY WOODRUFF: We come back now to the gun story. And we're joined by David Keene, president of the National Rifle Association. Welcome to the NewsHour.\n\nDAVID KEENE: Thank you for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said that critics who argue that gun control measures are an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He argued that these measures are simply commonsense safety measures. What is your response to that?\n\nDAVID KEENE: I believe that gun control measures are indeed an attack on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. These measures infringe upon the rights of those who have legally purchased and use firearms and have never committed a criminal act. While every amendment, including the Second Amendment, is subject to reasonable limits, the proposed gun control measures have not been proven to have a significant impact on preventing tragedies like the one in Connecticut. We need to focus on preventing these incidents rather than imposing unnecessary restrictions on law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly recently wrote an op-ed article arguing for stricter gun control measures. How do you respond to their arguments?\n\nDAVID KEENE: They specifically mentioned assault weapons, but it's important to note that assault weapons were not involved in the Giffords shooting. The AR-15, often referred to as an assault weapon, is a semiautomatic commercial rifle and the bestselling long gun in the United States. It is used by many for sport shooting and hunting. Banning these rifles based on cosmetic features would be an infringement on the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What about the argument that reducing high-capacity ammunition clips and implementing a ban on assault weapons could help reduce gun violence?\n\nDAVID KEENE: We have tried a ban on assault weapons before, and it did not make a significant difference. Additionally, there is no functional difference between an assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle. Banning them based on cosmetic features would not address the issue. Instead, we should focus on keeping firearms out of the hands of individuals who should not have them, such as those who have been adjudicated as potentially violent or mentally ill. Strengthening our background check system and addressing mental health issues can be effective ways to address gun violence without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any common ground between the NRA and the White House on gun control measures?\n\nDAVID KEENE: There is some potential for common ground, such as implementing background checks for individuals who have been adjudicated as potentially violent. The NRA has been advocating for this for the past 20 years. However, we do not support banning rifles that we believe would not make a significant difference in preventing gun violence. We also oppose the creation of a national gun registry.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Recent polls show that even in gun-owning households, there is support for measures such as reducing high-capacity ammunition clips and implementing background checks. How do you respond to these findings?\n\nDAVID KEENE: The Gallup poll actually showed no change in support for a ban on \"assault weapons.\" This indicates that people are more informed than politicians give them credit for. While there may be initial support for these measures, I believe that as the discussion evolves, people will recognize the importance of protecting Second Amendment rights while also preventing gun violence through more effective means like stronger background checks and addressing mental health issues.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you for joining us, David Keene, president of the NRA.\n\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, thank you.",

        "article": "Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back with a claim that he provides universal health care. However, a closer look at his plan reveals that it falls short of a guaranteed universal coverage.\n\nBoth Democratic presidential candidates share a lot in common when it comes to health care, but one key difference is Clinton's inclusion of a universal mandate. This means that individuals would be legally required to purchase health insurance. Obama's plan, on the other hand, only includes a mandate to insure children and lacks a mandate for adults, similar to the plans proposed by Clinton and Edwards. According to health policy expert Kenneth Thorpe, this difference is likely to result in fewer people being insured under Obama's plan.\n\nObama's decision to exclude a mandate for adults is seen as a more cautious approach to avoid penalizing those with modest incomes. If premiums do not decrease significantly after implementing reforms, these individuals may still be unable to afford insurance. Obama argues that mandating them to buy insurance, and subsequently fining them if they don't comply, would only punish the poor and leave them uninsured. Instead, he believes that his plan will lower costs enough to persuade a large number of the estimated 47 million uninsured Americans to voluntarily sign up, with a mandate potentially being added later on.\n\nAlthough Obama claims his plan will create market conditions for universal availability of health care, it does not guarantee it. While his approach may lead to increased coverage, nothing in his plan provides an assurance of universal health care. Therefore, his claim is considered Barely True.",

        "article": "DORSEY: Good afternoon and welcome to the White House. I am Jack Dorsey, from Twitter.\n\nThrough more than 200 million tweets per day, people around the world use Twitter to instantly connect to what's most meaningful to them. In every country -- Egypt and Japan, the UK and the United States -- much of this conversation is made up of everyday people engaging in spirited debate about the future of their countries.\n\nOur partners at Salesforce Radian6 studied more than a million tweets, discussing our nation's politics over the recent weeks, and they found that America's financial security to be one of the most actively talked about topics on Twitter. They further found that President Obama's name comes up in more than half of these conversations.\n\nAnd so today this vibrant discussion comes here to the White House and you get to ask the questions. To participate, just open your web browser and go to askObama.Twitter.com. Neither the President or I know the questions that will be asked today. That decision is driven entirely by the Twitter users.\n\nAnd so let's get the conversation started. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) First of all, everybody can sit down. (Laughter.) It's much easier to tweet from a seated position. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. DORSEY: And I understand you want to start the conversation off with a tweeter yourself.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm going to make history here as the first President to live tweet. So we've got a computer over here. (Types in tweet.)\n\nMR. DORSEY: It's only 140 characters. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right, I think I have done this properly. But here's the test.\n\nMR. DORSEY: And you tweeted.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: How about that? Not bad. (Applause.) Thank you. So I think my question will be coming up at some point.\n\nMR. DORSEY: So what was your question? Here it is.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here's the question: \"In order to reduce the deficit, what costs would you cut and what investments would you keep?\"\n\nAnd the reason I thought this was an important question is, as all of you know, we are going through a spirited debate here in Washington, but it's important to get the whole country involved, in making a determination about what are the programs that can help us grow, can create jobs, improve our education system, maintain our clean air and clean water, and what are those things that are a waste that we shouldn’t be investing in because they're not helping us grow or create jobs or creating new businesses. And that debate is going to be heating up over the next couple of weeks, so I'd love to hear from the American people, see what thoughts they have.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Excellent. Well, first question comes from a curator in New Hampshire. And we have eight curators around the country helping us pick tweets from the crowd so that we can read them to the President.\n\nAnd this one comes from William Smith: \"What mistakes have you made in handling this recession and what would you do differently?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's a terrific question. When I first came into office we were facing the worst recession since the Great Depression. So, looking around this room, it's a pretty young room -- it's certainly the worst recession that we've faced in our lifetimes. And we had to act quickly and make some bold and sometimes difficult decisions.\n\nIt was absolutely the right thing to do to put forward a Recovery Act that cut taxes for middle-class folks so they had more money in their pocket to get through the recession. It was the right thing to do to provide assistance to states to make sure that they didn’t have to lay off teachers and cops and firefighters as quickly as they needed to. And it was the right thing to do to try to rebuild our infrastructure and put people back to work building roads and bridges and so forth.\n\nIt also was the right thing to do, although a tough decision, to save the auto industry, which is now profitable and gaining market share -- the U.S. auto industry -- for the first time in a very long time.\n\nI think that -- probably two things that I would do differently. One would have been to explain to the American people that it was going to take a while for us to get out of this. I think even I did not realize the magnitude, because most economists didn’t realize the magnitude, of the recession until fairly far into it, maybe two or three months into my presidency where we started realizing that we had lost 4 million jobs before I was even sworn in.\n\nAnd so I think people may not have been prepared for how long this was going to take and why we were going to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices. And I take responsibility for that, because setting people’s expectations is part of how you end up being able to respond well.\n\nThe other area is in the area of housing. I think that the continuing decline in the housing market is something that hasn’t bottomed out as quickly as we expected. And that’s continued to be a big drag on the economy.\n\nWe’ve had to revamp our housing program several times to try to help people stay in their homes and try to start lifting home values up. But of all the things we’ve done, that’s probably been the area that’s been most stubborn to us trying to solve the problem.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 27 percent of our questions are in the jobs category, as you can see from the screen over here. Our next question has to do about jobs and technology. It comes from David: \"Tech and knowledge industries are thriving, yet jobs discussion always centers on manufacturing. Why not be realistic about jobs?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s not an either/or question; it’s a both/and question. We have to be successful at the cutting-edge industries of the future like Twitter. But we also have always been a country that makes stuff. And manufacturing jobs end up having both higher wages typically, and they also have bigger multiplier effects. So one manufacturing job can support a range of other jobs -- suppliers and the restaurant near the plant and so forth. So they end up having a substantial impact on the overall economy.\n\nWhat we want to focus on is advanced manufacturing that combines new technology, so research and development to figure out how are we going to create the next Twitter, how are we going to create the next Google, how are we going to create the next big thing -- but make sure that production is here.\n\nSo it’s great that we have an Apple that’s creating iPods, iPads and designing them and creating the software, but it would be nice if we’re also making the iPads and the iPods here in the United States, because that's some more jobs that people can work at.\n\nAnd there are going to be a series of decisions that we’ve got to make. Number one, are we investing in research and development in order to emphasize technology? And a lot of that has to come from government. That's how the Internet got formed. That's how GPS got formed. Companies on their own can’t always finance the basic research because they can’t be assured that they’re going to get a return on it.\n\nNumber two, we’ve got to drastically improve how we train our workforce and our kids around math and science and technology.\n\nNumber three, we’ve got to have a top-notch infrastructure to support advanced manufacturing, and we’ve got to look at sectors where we know this is going to be the future. Something like clean energy, for example. For us not to be the leaders in investing in clean energy manufacturing so that wind turbines and solar panels are not only designed here in the United States but made here in the United States makes absolutely no sense. We’ve got to invest in those areas for us to be successful.\n\nSo you can combine high-tech with manufacturing, and then you get the best of all worlds.\n\nMR. DORSEY: You mentioned education. There's a lot of questions coming about education and its impact on the economy. This one in particular is from a curator who is pulling from a student in Ohio, named Dustin: \"Higher ed is necessary for a stronger economy, but for some middle-class Americans it’s becoming too expensive. What can be done?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, here is some good news. We’ve already done something that is very significant, and people may not know. As part of a higher education package that we passed last year, what we were able to do was to take away subsidies that were going to banks for serving as middlemen in the student loan program and funnel that to help young people, through Pell Grants and lower rates on student loans. And so there are millions of students who are getting more affordable student loans and grants as a consequence of the steps that we’ve already taken. This is about tens of billions of dollars' worth of additional federal dollars that were going to banks are now going to students directly.\n\nIn addition, what we’ve said is that starting in 2013, young people who are going to college will not have to pay more than 10 percent of their income in repayment. And that obviously helps to relieve the burden on a lot students -- because, look, I’m a guy who had about $60,000 worth of debt when I graduated from law school, and Michelle had $60,000. And so we were paying a bigger amount every month than our mortgage. And we did that for eight, 10 years. So I know how burdensome this can be.\n\nI do think that the universities still have a role in trying to keep their costs down. And I think that it’s important -- even if we've got better student loan programs, more grants, if the costs keep on going up then we'll never have enough money, you'll never get enough help to avoid taking on these huge debts. And so working with university presidents to try to figure out, where can you cut costs -- of course, it may mean that the food in the cafeteria is a little worse and the gym is not as fancy. But I think all of us have to figure out a way to make sure that higher education is accessible for everybody.\n\nOne last point -- I know, Twitter, I’m supposed to be short. (Laughter.) But city -- community colleges is a huge, under-utilized resource, where what we want to do is set up a lifelong learning system where you may have gotten your four-year degree, but five years out you decide you want to go into another field or you want to brush up on new technologies that are going to help you advance. We need to create a system where you can conveniently access community colleges that are working with businesses to train for the jobs that actually exist. That’s a huge area where I think we can make a lot of progress.\n\nMR. DORSEY: You mention debt a lot. That’s come up in conversation a lot recently, especially in some of our recent questions, specifically the debt ceiling. And this is formulated in our next question from RenegadeNerd out of Atlanta: \"Mr. President, will you issue an executive order to raise the debt ceiling pursuant to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Can I just say, RenegadeNerd, that picture is -- captures it all there. (Laughter.) He's got his hand over there, he’s looking kind of confused. (Laughter.)\n\nLet me, as quickly as I can, describe what’s at stake with respect to the debt ceiling. Historically, the United States, whenever it has a deficit, it finances that deficit through the sale of treasuries. And this is a very common practice. Over our lifetimes, typically the government is always running a modest deficit. And Congress is supposed to vote on the amount of debt that Treasury can essentially issue. It’s a pretty esoteric piece of business; typically has not been something that created a lot of controversy.\n\nWhat’s happening now is, is that Congress is suggesting we may not vote to raise the debt ceiling. If we do not, then the Treasury will run out of money. It will not be able to pay the bills that are owing, and potentially the entire world capital markets could decide, you know what, the full faith and credit of the United States doesn’t mean anything. And so our credit could be downgraded, interest rates could go drastically up, and it could cause a whole new spiral into a second recession, or worse.\n\nSo this is something that we shouldn’t be toying with. What Dexter’s question referred to was there are some people who say that under the Constitution, it’s unconstitutional for Congress not to allow Treasury to pay its bills and are suggesting that this should be challenged under the Constitution.\n\nI don’t think we should even get to the constitutional issue. Congress has a responsibility to make sure we pay our bills. We’ve always paid them in the past. The notion that the U.S. is going to default on its debt is just irresponsible. And my expectation is, is that over the next week to two weeks, that Congress, working with the White House, comes up with a deal that solves our deficit, solves our debt problems, and makes sure that our full faith and credit is protected.\n\nMR. DORSEY: So back to jobs. We have a question from New York City about immigrant entrepreneurs: \"Immigrant entrepreneurs can build companies and create jobs for U.S. workers. Will you support a startup visa program?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What I want to do is make sure that talented people who come to this country to study, to get degrees, and are willing and interested in starting up businesses can do so, as opposed to going back home and starting those businesses over there to compete against the United States and take away U.S. jobs.\n\nSo we’re working with the business community as well as the entrepreneurial community to figure out are there ways that we can streamline the visa system so if you are studying here, you’ve got a PhD in computer science or you’ve got a PhD in engineering, and you say I’m ready to invest in the United States, create jobs in the United States, then we are able to say to you, we want you to stay here.\n\nAnd I think that it is possible for us to deal with this problem. But it’s important for us to look at it more broadly. We’ve got an immigration system that’s broken right now, where too many folks are breaking the law but also our laws make it too hard for talented people to contribute and be part of our society. And we’ve always been a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And so we need comprehensive immigration reform, part of which would allow entrepreneurs and high-skilled individuals to stay here -- because we want to be attracting that talent here. We don’t want that -- we don’t want to pay for training them here and then having them benefit other countries.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Our next question was just -- was sent just an hour ago and touches on alternative energy and job creation: \"Will you focus on promoting alternative energy industries in oil states like Louisiana and Texas?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I want to promote alternative energy everywhere, including oil states like Louisiana and Texas. This is something that I’m very proud of and doesn’t get a lot of attention. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history through the Recovery Act. And so we put forward a range of programs that provided credits and grants to startup companies in areas like creating wind turbines, solar panels.\n\nA great example is advanced battery manufacturing. When I came into office, advanced batteries, which are used, for example, in electric cars, we only accounted for 2 percent of the world market in advanced batteries. And we have quintupled our market share, or even gone further, just over the last two years. And we’re projecting that we can get to 30 to 40 percent of that market. That’s creating jobs all across the Midwest, all across America.\n\nAnd whoever wins this race on advanced battery manufacturing is probably going to win the race to produce the cars of the 21st century. China is investing in it. Germany is investing in it. We need to be investing in it as well.\n\nMR. DORSEY: I wanted to take a moment and point out the map just behind you. These are tweets coming in, in real time, and these are questions being asked right now. And it flips between the various categories that we’ve determined and also just general askObama questions.\n\nSo our next question is coming up on the screen now, from Patrick: “Mr. President, in several states we have seen people lose their collective bargaining rights. Do you have a plan to rectify this?”\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The first thing I want to emphasize is that collective bargaining is the reason why the vast majority of Americans enjoy a minimum wage, enjoy weekends, enjoy overtime. So many things that we take for granted are because workers came together to bargain with their employers.\n\nNow, we live in a very competitive society in the 21st century. And that means in the private sector, labor has to take management into account. If labor is making demands that make management broke and they can’t compete, then that doesn’t do anybody any good.\n\nIn the public sector, what is true is that some of the pension plans that have been in place and the health benefits that are in place are so out of proportion with what’s happening in the private sector that a lot of taxpayers start feeling resentful. They say, well, if I don’t have health care where I only have to pay $1 for prescription drugs, why is it that the person whose salary I’m paying has a better deal?\n\nWhat this means is, is that all of us are going to have to make some adjustments. But the principle of collective bargaining, making sure that people can exercise their rights to be able to join together with other workers and to negotiate and kind of even the bargaining power on either side, that’s something that has to be protected. And we can make these adjustments in a way that are equitable but preserve people’s collective bargaining rights.\n\nSo, typically, the challenges against bargaining rights have been taking place at the state level. I don't have direct control over that. But what I can do is to speak out forcefully for the principle that we can make these adjustments that are necessary during these difficult fiscal times, but do it in a way that preserves collective bargaining rights. And certainly at the federal level where I do have influence, I can make sure that we make these adjustments without affecting people’s collective bargaining rights.\n\nI'll give you just one example. We froze federal pay for federal workers for two years. Now, that wasn’t real popular, as you might imagine, among federal workers. On the other hand, we were able to do that precisely because we wanted to prevent layoffs and we wanted to make sure that we sent a signal that everybody is going to have to make some sacrifices, including federal workers.\n\nBy the way, people who work in the White House, they’ve had their pay frozen since I came in, our high-wage folks. So they haven’t had a raise in two and a half years, and that's appropriate, because a lot of ordinary folks out there haven’t, either. In fact, they’ve seen their pay cut in some cases.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 6 percent of our questions are coming in about housing, which you can see in the graph behind me. And this one in particular has to do with personal debt and housing: “How will admin work to help underwater homeowners who aren’t behind in payments but are trapped in homes they can’t sell?” From Robin.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is a great question. And remember, I mentioned one of our biggest challenges during the course of the last two and a half years has been dealing with a huge burst of the housing bubble.\n\nWhat's happened is a lot of folks are underwater, meaning their home values went down so steeply and so rapidly that now their mortgage, the amount they owe, is a lot more than the assessed worth of their home. And that obviously burdens a lot of folks. It means if they’re selling, they’ve got to sell at a massive loss that they can’t afford. It means that they don’t feel like they have any assets because the single biggest asset of most Americans is their home.\n\nSo what we’ve been trying to do is to work with the issuers of the mortgages, the banks or the service companies, to convince them to work with homeowners who are paying, trying to do the right thing, trying to stay in their homes, to see if they can modify the loans so that their payments are lower, and in some cases, maybe even modify their principal, so that they don’t feel burdened by these huge debts and feel tempted to walk away from homes that actually they love and where they’re raising their families.\n\nWe’ve made some progress. We have, through the programs that we set up here, have probably seen several million home modifications either directly because we had control of the loan process, or because the private sector followed suit. But it’s not enough. And so we’re going back to the drawing board, talking to banks, try to put some pressure on them to work with people who have mortgages to see if we can make further adjustments, modify loans more quickly, and also see if there may be circumstances where reducing principal is appropriate.\n\nMR. DORSEY: And our next question comes from someone you may know. This is Speaker Boehner.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, there you go. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. DORSEY: “After embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?” And I want to note that these characters are his fault. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all --\n\nMR. DORSEY: Not his fault, not his fault.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- John obviously needs to work on his typing skills. (Laughter.) Well, look, obviously John is the Speaker of the House, he’s a Republican, and so this is a slightly skewed question. (Laughter.) But what he’s right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need. I mean, we lost, as I said, 4 million jobs before I took office, before I was sworn in. About 4 million jobs were lost in the few months right after I took office before our economic policies had a chance to take any effect.\n\nAnd over the last 15 months, we’ve actually seen two million jobs created in the private sector. And so we’re each month seeing growth in jobs, But when you’ve got a 8 million dollar -- 8-million-job hole and you’re only filling it 100,000-200,000 jobs at a time each month, obviously that’s way too long for a lot of folks who are still out of work.\n\nThere are a couple of things that we can continue to do. I actually worked with Speaker Boehner to pass a payroll tax cut in December that put an extra $1,000 in the pockets of almost every single American. That means they’re spending money. That means that businesses have customers. And that has helped improve overall growth.\n\nWe have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling, including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if they’re successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business.\n\nSo we’ve been able to cooperate with Republicans on a range of these issues. There are some areas where the Republicans have been more resistant in cooperating, even though I think most objective observers think it’s the right thing to do. I’ll give you a specific example.\n\nIt’s estimated that we have about $2 trillion worth of infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt. Roads, bridges, sewer lines, water mains; our air traffic control system doesn’t make sense. We don’t have the kind of electric grid that’s smart, meaning it doesn’t waste a lot of energy in transmission. Our broadband system is slower than a lot of other countries.\n\nFor us to move forward on a major infrastructure initiative where we’re putting people to work right now -- including construction workers who were disproportionately unemployed when the housing bubble went bust -- to put them to work rebuilding America at a time when interest rates are very low, contractors are looking for work, and the need is there, that is something that could make a huge, positive impact on the economy overall. And it’s an example of making an investment now that ends up having huge payoffs down the road.\n\nWe haven’t gotten the kind of cooperation that I’d like to see on some of those ideas and initiatives. But I’m just going to keep on trying and eventually I’m sure the Speaker will see the light. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. DORSEY: Speaking of startups, there’s a ton of questions about small businesses and how they affect job creation. This one comes from Neal: “Small biz create jobs. What incentives are you willing to support to improve small business growth?”\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I just mentioned some of the tax breaks that we’ve provided not only to small businesses, but also in some cases were provided big businesses. For example, if they’re making investments in plants and equipment this year, they can fully write down those costs, take -- essentially depreciate all those costs this year and that saves them a pretty big tax bill. So we’re already initiating a bunch of steps.\n\nThe biggest challenge that I hear from small businesses right now actually has to do with financing, because a lot of small businesses got their financing from community banks. Typically, they’re not getting them from the big Wall Street banks, but they’re getting them from their various regional banks in their communities. A lot of those banks were pretty over-extended in the commercial real estate market, which has been hammered. A lot of them are still digging themselves out of bad loans that they made that were shown to be bad during the recession.\n\nAnd so, what we’ve tried to do is get the Small Business Administration, the federal agency that helps small businesses, to step in and to provide more financing -- waiving fees, seeing if we can lower interest rates in some cases, making sure that the threshold for companies that qualify for loans are more generous. And that’s helped a lot of small businesses all across the country. And this is another example of where, working with Congress, my hope is, is that we can continue to provide these tax incentives and maybe do even a little bit more.\n\nQ Our next question was tweeted less than five minutes ago and comes to us from Craig: “My question is, can you give companies a tax break if they hire an honorable discharged veteran?”\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is something that I’ve been talking a lot about internally. We’ve got all these young people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan; have made incredible sacrifices; have taken on incredible responsibilities. You see some 23-year-old who's leading a platoon in hugely dangerous circumstances, making decisions, operating complex technologies. These are folks who can perform. But, unfortunately, what we’re seeing is that a lot of these young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn’t serve. And that makes no sense.\n\nSo what we’d like to do is potentially combine a tax credit for a company that hires veterans with a campaign to have private companies step up and do the right thing and hire more veterans. And one of the things that we’ve done is internally in the federal government we have made a huge emphasis on ramping up our outreach to veterans and the hiring of veterans, and this has been a top priority of mine. The notion that these guys who are sacrificing for our freedom and our security end up coming home and not being able to find a job I think is unacceptable.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, this next question comes from someone else you may recognize. And what's interesting about this question, it was heavily retweeted and voted up by our userbase. This comes from NickKristof: “Was it a mistake to fail to get Republicans to commit to raise the debt ceiling at the same time tax cuts were extended?”\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Nicholas is a great columnist. But I have to tell you the assumption of the question is, is that I was going to be able to get them to commit to raising the debt ceiling.\n\nIn December, we were in what was called the lame duck session. The Republicans knew that they were going to be coming in as the majority. We only had a few short weeks to deal with a lot of complicated issues, including repealing \"don't ask, don't tell,\" dealing with a START treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, and come to terms with a budget. And what we were able to do was negotiate a package where we agreed to do something that we didn’t like but that the Republicans badly wanted, which is to extend the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy for another two years.\n\nIn exchange, we were able to get this payroll tax that put $1,000 -- tax cut that put $1,000 in the pockets of every family in America, which would help economic growth and jobs. We were also able to get unemployment insurance extended for the millions of Americans out there who are still out of work and whose benefits were about to run out. And that was a much better deal than I think a lot of people expected.\n\nIt would have been great if we were able to also settle this issue of the debt ceiling at that time. That wasn’t the deal that was available. But here’s the more basic point: Never in our history has the United States defaulted on its debt. The debt ceiling should not be something that is used as a gun against the heads of the American people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners, or oil and gas companies that are making billions of dollars because the price of gasoline has gone up so high.\n\nI’m happy to have those debates. I think the American people are on my side on this. What we need to do is to have a balanced approach where everything is on the table. We need to reduce corporate loopholes. We need to reduce discretionary spending on programs that aren’t working. We need to reduce defense spending. Everything has -- we need to look at entitlements, and we have to say, how do we protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security for not just this generation but also future generations. And that’s going to require some modifications, even as we maintain its basic structure.\n\nSo what I’m hoping to see over the next couple of weeks is people put their dogmas aside, their sacred cows aside; they come together and they say, here’s a sensible approach that reduces our deficit, makes sure that government is spending within its means, but also continues to make investments in education, in clean energy, and basic research that are going to preserve our competitive advantage going forward.\n\nMR. DORSEY: So speaking of taxes, our next question is coming from us -- from Alabama, from Lane: \"What changes to the tax system do you think are necessary to help solve the deficit problem and for the system to be fair?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that, first of all, it’s important for people to realize that since I’ve been in office I’ve cut taxes for middle-class families, repeatedly. The Recovery Act cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. The payroll tax cut that we passed in December put an extra thousand dollars in the pockets of every family in America.\n\nAnd so we actually now have the lowest tax rates since the 1950s. Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. They’re lower than they were under George Bush -- senior or George Bush, junior. They’re lower than they were under Bill Clinton.\n\nThe question is how do we pay for the things that we all think are important and how do we make sure that the tax system is equitable? And what I’ve said is that in addition to eliminating a whole bunch of corporate loopholes that are just not fair -- the.\n\nPlease note that this news article is a hypothetical example created by the OpenAI GPT-3 model and is not an actual news article.",

        "title": "Hurricane Irma: If There Was Such A Thing As A Category 6 Hurricane, This Would Be It",
        "article": "Facebook Twitter Reddit EmailHurricane Irma has become even stronger than the most extreme forecasts were projecting. According to the National Hurricane Center, Irma had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour at one point on Tuesday. That makes it the strongest Atlantic hurricane in history “outside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean”. I was criticized for suggesting that Irma could become so powerful that it could potentially be labeled a “category 6” storm if such a thing existed. Well, now it has actually happened. If you extrapolate the Saffir-Simpson scale, “category 6” would begin at 158 knots, which would be 181.8 miles per hour. Since Irma has surpassed that mark, I believe that it is entirely reasonable if people want to refer to it as a “category 6” storm.Of course some meteorologists will get very heated with you when you use the term “category 6” because no such category exists at this point.But we need some way to describe an Atlantic hurricane with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour. “Category 5” simply does not do such a storm justice, and yes, Hurricane Irma is the type of storm that could wipe entire cities off the map if it came ashore at this power.We don’t know where this immensely powerful storm will make landfall in the U.S. yet, but you don’t want to be there when it does. I don’t want to freak people out, but the truth is that the best thing you can do is to get as far away from this storm as you can.Just remember what happened in Houston. The people were told not to evacuate, and that turned out to be an absolutely disastrous decision.This is not just another storm. This is a history making event, and if Irma slams directly into one of our major cities as a category 5 storm, it could potentially make Hurricane Harvey look like a Sunday picnic. The following are some of the key things that you need to know about Hurricane Irma…#1 According to the Miami Herald, Hurricane Irma had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour on Tuesday afternoon…Irma continued to explode into a powerful storm Tuesday afternoon, with winds increasing to 185 mph, National Hurricane Center forecasters said in a 2 p.m. advisory. As the storm continued to track westward, islands in its path raced to complete last minute preparations. The Leeward Islands are expected to get hit with “catastrophic” winds tonight, forecasters said, with the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico slammed tomorrow. In Puerto Rico, the governor asked President Donald Trump to declare a state of emergency, while the electric company warned Irma’s fierce winds could leave the island without power for four to six months.#2 The NOAA is saying that Irma is “the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic — outside the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico.”#3 As mentioned above, if you extrapolate the Saffir-Simpson scale, Irma could be considered a category 6 storm…While few are willing to admit it yet, according to meteorologist Ryan Maye, Hurricane Irma is still intensifying, with winds up to 155-knots (180 mph) and that extrapolating Saffir-Simpson scale, 158-knots would be Category 6.Yes, I know that a “category 6” does not exist yet, but perhaps it is about time that scientists got together and updated the scale in light of the dangerous new realities that we are now facing.#4 Hurricane Irma is so enormously powerful that it is even “showing up on seismometers”…Hurricane Irma is so strong it’s showing up on seismometers — equipment designed to measure earthquakes. “What we’re seeing in the seismogram are low-pitched hums that gradually become stronger as the hurricane gets closer to the seismometer on the island of Guadeloupe,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom.#5 In all of U.S. history, only three category 5 hurricanes have ever hit the United States – an unnamed storm in 1935, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992.#6 A state of emergency has already been declared for every single county in the state of Florida.#7 If you are in the “danger zone” and you have not already stockpiled food, water and supplies, it is probably already too late. Reports of “panic prepping” are coming in from all over Florida, and down in Puerto Rico many stores are already out of all the most important supplies…On Tuesday, the lines for fast-dwindling gas, food, water and hardware were interminable and anxiety mounted. One hardware store in San Juan had been nearly picked clean by afternoon. “This has been like this for the last three days,” said Juan Carlos Ramirez, the store manager. “We’ve sold all of the most necessary items — flashlight, batteries, plywood.”One of my readers made the point the other day that this isn’t the kind of storm that you can “prepare” for.And my reader was precisely correct. You can’t “get prepared” for a hurricane with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour. Such a storm will snap homes like toothpicks.If I was in Florida, I would be heading north immediately. Those that wait could find themselves in absolutely nightmarish traffic jams.And if I lived on the Gulf coast, I would be watching this storm very, very carefully.Because the waters in the Gulf of Mexico are so warm, there is the possibility that Irma could get even stronger if it slides to the south of Florida.Let us hope that it does not happen, but a scenario in which Irma makes landfall along the Gulf coast as a category 5 storm would probably be the worst of all potential possibilities.If such a scenario plays out, please get out of the path of this storm. Trying to “ride this storm out” would do you no good whatsoever.Michael Snyder is a Republican candidate for Congress in Idaho’s First Congressional District, and you can learn how you can get involved in the campaign on his official website.

        "article": "Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes have emerged as opposing voices in the ongoing debate about the role of money in U.S. elections. The Kentucky Senate race has become a battleground for campaign cash, with both candidates and outside groups raising enormous amounts of money. It is expected to become the most expensive race in U.S. history, surpassing the $100 million mark.\n\nMitch McConnell, known for his stance on loosening campaign finance regulations, staunchly believes that money and free speech are synonymous. He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals. McConnell's position has made him the face of campaign finance deregulation.\n\nOn the other hand, in a statement to supporters on March 17, Alison Lundergan Grimes strongly condemned the influence of wealthy donors on elections and singled out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of the current system. Grimes stated, \"Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnell’s campaign... He’s the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth's airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enough—our democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.\"\n\nGrimes has been cautious on other controversial issues on the campaign trail, but her stance against the influence of money in politics has received applause from watchdog groups. David Donnelly, executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund, stated, \"It's very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again. She understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of everyday Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating to make the problem worse.\"\n\nGrimes has also urged voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to \"stop special interest billionaires,\" which has received support from red state Democratic senators. Kentucky's Senate race has seen the involvement of over 1,000 registered super PACs, generating over $141 million and spending more than $24.8 million on races.\n\nWhile McConnell has spent over half of the $20 million raised this cycle and has numerous outside groups spending millions on advertisements supporting his re-election, his approval ratings remain low. Grimes, on the other hand, either leads or ties McConnell in most polling.\n\nFormer FEC Chairman Michael Toner argues that while independent expenditure committees may not directly advance a candidate's interest, spending more money does not guarantee victory. Despite Grimes raising $4.5 million and receiving support from Democratic donors, she has faced attack ads from outside liberal groups who criticize McConnell.\n\nThe McConnell campaign highlighted the irony of Grimes criticizing Citizens United while benefiting from attack ads against the senator from liberal groups. Allison Moore, McConnell's campaign spokesperson, stated, \"Like Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections. The sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact that the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.\"\n\nWatchdog groups argue that while all elected officials and candidates benefit from wealthy donors, the real distinction lies in their actions to clean up the system. According to Donnelly, Grimes is seen as a champion for campaign finance reform, while McConnell is viewed as someone who will exacerbate the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the Kentucky Senate race between McConnell and Grimes has become a battleground for campaign finance, with record-breaking amounts of money being raised. The candidates' differing stances on the role of money in politics highlight the sharp divide on this issue. Despite the involvement of super PACs and attack ads, the outcome of the race remains uncertain.",

        "article": "Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBill Clinton's novel sees fastest fiction sales in two years From Singapore, skepticism and hope The Memo: Summit gives Trump political boost — with risks MORE’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSessions defends firing Comey, warns DOJ report could prompt more terminations Sanders gets best reception at early 2020 audition Hillicon Valley: DHS gets new cyber chief | White House warns lawmakers not to block ZTE deal | White nationalists find home on Google Plus | Comcast outbids Disney for Fox | Anticipation builds for report on FBI Clinton probe MORE served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.ADVERTISEMENTRather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderHolder redistricting group backs lawsuits for 3 additional majority-black congressional districts Liberal groups launches ads against prospective Trump Supreme Court nominees Ready for somebody? Dems lack heir apparent this time MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a “racketeering scheme” that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.“As part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,” Agent David Gadren testified.“Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,” the agent added.The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump Donald John TrumpAvenatti: 'I think that Michael Cohen is in a very, very bad spot' MSNBC reporter: Detained immigrant children 'effectively incarcerated' in Texas facility GOP chairwoman: Anyone who doesn't support Trump 'will be making a mistake' MORE’s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired earlier this year.Its many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.The case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia’s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.One of Mikerin’s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency’s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.By that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’s approval.The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, “a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison” and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin’s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.“I had no idea this case was being conducted,” a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.Former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal.“Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,” he said. “The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.”This story was updated at 6:50 p.m.Indictment Affidavit by M Mali on ScribdWarrant Affidavit by M Mali on ScribdMikerin Plea Deal by M Mali on Scribd",

        "title": "Hannity Claims Obama Avoids Using \"War on Terrorism\" Phrase",
        "article": "On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on November 9, 2009, the discussion revolved around what the government knew about Nidal Malik Hasan, the Army major responsible for the Fort Hood shooting that resulted in the deaths of 13 people and wounded 30 others.\n\nDuring the segment, Hannity expressed his belief that the government might have had prior knowledge about Hasan but failed to act due to a fear of being labeled as Islamophobic. He stated, \"There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe.\"\n\nHannity further questioned Obama's response to the incident, stating, \"Now, this is a terrorist act. What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?\"\n\nCritics have often targeted President Obama for not using the phrase \"global war on terrorism\" coined by his predecessor, George W. Bush. To investigate this claim, a word search of Obama's public statements was conducted. Results showed that although Obama frequently used the term \"war on terrorism\" during his campaign, he rarely used it as president. Instead, he primarily used the phrase \"war on terror,\" but only on a couple of occasions.\n\nTwo instances were found where Obama directly addressed this matter. During an interview with al-Arabiya, an Arabic-language television news station, on January 27, 2009, Obama stated that he preferred to distinguish between extremist organizations like al-Qaida and individuals who may disagree with his administration or have different perspectives on the development of their countries.\n\nLater, in a February 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Obama reiterated his avoidance of the term \"war on terror.\" He emphasized the importance of selecting language carefully to win the battle of hearts and minds, acknowledging that terrorism isn't representative of the broader Muslim or Arab communities.\n\nWhile it can be argued that not using the phrase \"war on terror\" became a general White House policy, an e-mailed memo claimed that the Obama administration preferred alternative terms such as \"Overseas Contingency Operation.\" However, a spokesman from the White House Office of Management and Budget denied issuing such guidance and stated that it was the opinion of a career civil servant.\n\nObama faced criticism for not specifically mentioning the words \"terror\" or \"terrorism\" during a speech in Cairo on June 4, 2009, targeted towards Muslims worldwide. However, John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, clarified that the absence of these terms reflected Obama's new approach, emphasizing the focus on combating al-Qaida and its violent extremist allies.\n\nIn conclusion, while Obama did use the phrase \"war on terror\" on a few occasions, he generally opted for different terminology. Hannity's claim that Obama avoids using the term \"war on terrorism\" is, therefore, rated as True. The president has provided nuanced explanations for his word choices, showcasing that he intentionally refrains from employing the phrase \"war on terrorism.\"",

        "article": "The newly appointed Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, faces the challenge of managing the influx of funds from the stimulus package as well as the responsibility to drive meaningful change in the education system. While some view this as an opportunity for power, Duncan emphasizes that his motivation lies in utilizing the resources to enhance opportunities for students and improve schools.\n\nDuncan plans to reward districts, charter schools, and non-profit organizations that have demonstrated success in improving student achievement, referring to them as \"islands of excellence.\" Programs that link teacher pay to classroom performance and initiatives focused on raising teacher quality, such as mentorship programs and tutoring services, are likely to receive funding support.\n\nThe stimulus funding will help states alleviate some of the education budget cuts expected for the 2009-2010 academic year, caused by the current state budget shortfalls totaling approximately $132 billion. For example, California, facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, will receive an estimated $11 billion in education funds from the stimulus package, helping to mitigate the impact on school spending.\n\nDue to the vacant deputy secretary, under secretary, chief of staff, and other senior positions at the Education Department, Duncan is relying on assistance from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to swiftly develop procedures for the quick distribution of the stimulus funds. Many of his aides have been working beyond regular office hours to organize and streamline the effort.\n\nArne Duncan's approach to his new role includes a more informal style, asking department employees to address him by his first name. By fostering open communication and collaboration, Duncan aims to create an environment that prioritizes effective use of the stimulus funds and drives impactful change in the education system.\n\nSource: The New York Times",

Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism, and social mobility.\n\nIn a 2007 statement, Gingrich declared his political ideology, stating, \"It's not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.\"\n\nGingrich highlights key instances in American history to support his viewpoint. He references how the government provided railroad land grants to encourage the widespread adoption of a modern transportation system. Similarly, the Homestead Act gave away land to those willing to live on and develop it. Gingrich further points out that public-private partnerships were employed to bring telephone service and electricity to all communities in the nation. These examples demonstrate how government involvement can serve public purposes without leading to excessive bureaucracy.\n\nThis consistent theme in Gingrich's career sets him apart, highlighted by his 1984 book, \"Window of Opportunity.\" In the book, he vehemently criticizes the \"laissez-faire\" conservatism, which promotes the idea that the government should step back and let the market flourish. Gingrich argues that an opportunity society requires active government intervention to foster growth and provide equal opportunities.\n\nDespite facing criticism and encountering tumultuous political phases, Gingrich's unwavering belief in the power of limited government intervention to drive growth and social progress remains a defining aspect of his philosophy.",

        "article": "Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Republican from Arizona, has criticized President Obama for not being aggressive enough in taking the fight to ISIS militants who have devastated Iraq and Syria. With ISIS making territorial gains in the Middle East, there is a renewed debate about the best approach to counter their threat. Lawmakers are divided between supporting a military strategy or a political resolution to address the issue.\n\nSenator McCain emphasized the need for a more robust strategy and called for additional troops on the ground, as well as forward air controllers and special forces. He pointed out that without the right strategy, airpower alone is not effective in battling ISIS. McCain believes that there is currently no clear strategy and challenges those who claim otherwise to explain their approach.\n\nOn the other hand, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, argues that long-lasting victories in Iraq are contingent upon resolving political differences within the country. Schiff highlights the previous example of winning the city of Ramadi during the Iraq War, but being unable to retain control due to unresolved political challenges. He emphasized the need for the Iraqi government to fully incorporate the Sunnis and address the integration of Sunni forces into the military.\n\nSchiff voiced concerns about introducing a large number of American troops, suggesting that it could exacerbate the existing threat posed by ISIS and potentially escalate the conflict. He argues that past experiences indicate that additional forces alone will not lead to a lasting solution.\n\nMcCain contends that President Obama's decision to completely withdraw troops from Iraq in 2011, following the successful troop surge implemented under President George W. Bush in 2007, was a mistake. He believes that Obama should have followed a similar strategy to maintain stability in the region.\n\nIn the current situation, Schiff suggests a state of stalemate in the war against ISIS, with occasional fluctuations. He expresses concerns that the administration is focusing on the number of bombing runs rather than important metrics such as stopping the influx of foreign fighters, cutting off ISIS' resources, addressing the ideological fight within Islam, and ensuring proper military support from allied nations.",

She gave an answer from her heart.\"\n\nShortly after Trump's comments, Prejean herself reiterated his statement while addressing reporters. She emphasized that her views on marriage were shared not only by Obama but also by the sitting secretary of state and many other Americans. \n\nDuring the final round of the Miss USA pageant, Prejean was asked by judge Perez Hilton about her stance on same-sex marriage. Her response was as follows: \"I think in my country, in my family, I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised.\"\n\nPrejean's remarks have sparked intense debate and garnered considerable attention from both supporters and critics. While some applaud her for expressing her personal beliefs, others argue that her answer contradicts the principle of inclusivity and equality that the Miss USA competition stands for.\n\nIt is worth noting that Barack Obama himself, during his presidency, openly expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage in 2008. However, he later changed his stance and became a vocal advocate for marriage equality, ultimately supporting the legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.\n\nAs the controversy surrounding Prejean's remarks continues to unfold, it highlights the complex and deeply divisive nature of the ongoing debate on gay marriage in the United States.",

        "article": "The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.“ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.“Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”“Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as \"unjust and cruel.\"Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’Sessions called California’s \"open borders\" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”“It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound policy?”",

        "article": "Washington (CNN) Former national security adviser Susan Rice privately told House investigators that she unmasked the identities of senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York late last year, multiple sources told CNN.The New York meeting preceded a separate effort by the UAE to facilitate a back-channel communication between Russia and the incoming Trump White House.The crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, arrived in New York last December in the transition period before Trump was sworn into office for a meeting with several top Trump officials, including Michael Flynn, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his top strategist Steve Bannon, sources said.The Obama administration felt misled by the United Arab Emirates, which had failed to mention that Zayed was coming to the United States even though it's customary for foreign dignitaries to notify the US government about their travels, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Rice, who served as then-President Obama's national security adviser in his second term, told the House Intelligence Committee last week that she requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally, a practice officials in both parties say is common.Rice's previously undisclosed revelation in a classified setting shines new light on a practice that had come under sharp criticism from the committee chairman, California Rep. Devin Nunes, and President Donald Trump, who previously accused Rice of committing a crimeBut her explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump and raising new questions about whether any Trump associates tried to arrange back-channel discussions with the Russians.\"I didn't hear anything to believe that she did anything illegal,\" Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican helping to lead the panel's Russia invesigation, told CNN of Rice's testimony. He declined to discuss any of the contents of her classified remarks.Through a spokeswoman, Rice declined to comment about her testimony. Nunes refused to answer questions when asked about Rice Tuesday evening.It's unclear precisely which Trump officials Rice discussed at the House meeting. But multiple sources have confirmed to CNN that Zayed met at the time with Flynn, Kushner and Bannon. The three-hour discussion focused on a range of issues, including Iran, Yemen and the Mideast peace process, according to two sources who insisted that opening up a back-channel with Russia was not a topic of discussion.Still, the fact that the New York meeting occurred prior to the Seychelles session and that the UAE did not notify the Obama administration about why the crown prince was coming to the United States has raised questions in the eyes of investigators on Capitol Hill.A secret meeting in the SeychellesBut the Trump Tower meeting came shortly before the UAE brokered a meeting to open lines of communications with the United States and Russia, with a clandestine January meeting in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, according to reports in CNN and The Washington Post. That meeting is now under investigation on Capitol Hill, though it's unclear whether Rice mentioned the Seychelles meeting in the testimony.A senior Middle East official told CNN that the UAE did not \"mislead\" the Obama administration about the crown prince's visit, but acknowledged not telling the US government about it in advance. The meeting, which took place December 15, 2016, the official said, was simply an effort to build a relationship with senior members of the Trump team who would be working in the administration to share assessments of the region.\"The meeting was about ascertaining the Trump team's view of the region and sharing the UAE's view of the region and what the US role should be,\" the official said. \"No one was coming in to sell anything or arrange anything.\"A spokesperson for the crown prince declined to comment.The Seychelles meeting -- and the circumstances around it -- has been a subject of interest to Hill investigators looking at any potential link between the Trump campaign and Russia.The Washington Post initially reported in April that the UAE brokered a pre-inauguration meeting between the founder of the security firm Blackwater, Erik Prince, who is a close Trump ally, and an associate of Vladimir Putin's in the Seychelles Islands. The purpose of the meeting was part of an effort by the UAE to persuade Russia to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, according to the Post.And it occured shortly after Bannon, Flynn and Kushner also met in Trump Tower with Zayed, whom the Post said helped arrange the Seychelles meeting with Russia government officials to set up the private discussions with the Trump team.But the senior Middle East official told CNN this week that Prince's name was not discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. And Prince himself has said he did nothing wrong, telling CNN's Erin Burnett last month: \"I was there for business.\"Both the White House and Prince have strongly denied that Prince was working as a liaison for the Trump administration.Prince said he met with a Russian while at the Seychelles but \"I don't remember his name.\"\"It probably lasted about, as long as one beer,\" he said about the meeting.Explaining 'unmasking'For her part, Rice had been called to the House Intelligence Committee to testify partly over what Nunes and other Republicans believed was an abuse in the practice of \"unmasking\" -- or revealing the identities of Americans who were communicating with foreign officials under surveillance by the US intelligence community. Simply unmasking the names of individuals in classified reports does not mean that their identities will be revealed publicly, and Rice denied to the committee that she leaked classified information to the press, sources familiar with the matter said.But Rice's suggestion that she unmasked the names of US individuals -- who turned out to be Trump associates -- over concerns about the propriety of the crown prince's visit to the United States could help her fend off attacks that she was out of line in the actions she took.Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who is helping lead the House investigation, told the Daily Caller \"nothing that came up in her interview that led me to conclude\" that she improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates or leaked it to the press.Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, did not say explicitly whether Trump still believes Rice committed a crime but added the issue of leaking and unmasking needs to be investigated.\"We've seen illegal leaking of classified materials, including the identities of American citizens unmasked in intelligence reports,\" Sanders told CNN. \"That's why the President called for Congress to investigate this matter and why the Department of Justice and Intelligence Community are doing all they can to stamp out this dangerous trend that undermines our national security.\"Nunes was forced to step aside from running the Russia investigation amid a House ethics inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified data. The ethics inquiry came in the aftermath of his bombshell comments that Obama administration officials had improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates, a revelation that Trump used as cover for his unsubstantiated claim that Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped during the election to spy on him. The Justice Department said in a court filing Friday that the DOJ and the FBI have no evidence to support Trump's claims.But on Tuesday, the Republican who took over the investigation from Nunes said there was no reason to bring Rice in for further questioning.\"She was a good witness, answered all our questions,\" Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican now running the House Russia probe, told CNN. \"I'm not aware of any reason to bring her back.\"",

        "article": "Malia Obama may have done irreparable harm to her career this morning when she decided to join a gang of thugs in Chicago for a day of drinking, drugs and dogfighting at a public park in Chicago. Malia was arrested along with seven others and charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance.She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park. According to a witness:“They was all just right out there in the open drinkin’ and lettin’ their dogs go at it. I saw some smoking weed. Some were doing other things I don’t know. All those dudes had that baggy pants thing. They weren’t the types of people you’d expect that girl to be with.”According to the Secret Service, Malia had slipped away late last night after being told open air parties at public parks were too dangerous. She wasn’t seen again until she showed up in the 12th precinct jail. Her parents have not been available for comment.Public records show she was released on her own recognizance and given a court date of later this month for arraignment.",

CloseThe “War on Christmas” catchphrase was coined by former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, who claimed in 2004 that Christmas was “under siege” by “secular progressives.” It was triggered when the department store Macy’s decided not to greet customers with “Merry Christmas” but to wish them “Happy Holidays” instead.O’Reilly seized on that as an example of an organized effort to eliminate Christian religious symbols in American public life. He and other right-wing commentators were following in the footsteps of a tradition dating back to the 1950s and the far-right John Birch Society, which claimed a communist conspiracy was hell-bent on taking “the Christ out of Christmas,” also blaming \"fantatics\" at the UN for trying to \"poison the 1959 Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda.\">>Ex-Marine who plotted San Francisco Christmas attack claims he was angry about Trump 'giving Jerusalem to the Jews'skip - Trump Christmas tweetThis is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most.

In 2011, Trump went as far as to falsely accuse then-President Barack Obama of failing to send Christmas greetings, while remembering to mark the African festival of Kwanzaa.In part of his effort to rally evangelical Christians to his camp, Trump made the issue a running theme during his 2016 presidential election campaign, repeatedly promising at his rallies that he would “bring back” the phrase “Merry Christmas.”skip - Sarah Huckabee Sanders>>The Palestinians just gave Netanyahu what he always wanted for Christmas | Analysisskip - Sanders reaction 1No one else find it oddly concerning at WH press conference today Sarah Sanders started with bringing up Christmas as “ birth of our savior “.....not all Americans would agree that this was appropriate place to discuss her religion — Karen Delaney (@KarenDelaney9) December 7, 2017skip - Sanders reaction 2@PressSec The stories of giving & of stepping up were inspirational, as you intended.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of evangelical leader and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, invoked Christian belief during her briefing on December 7, with a tale designed to “shine a spotlight” on seasonal “generosity.” She related the story of St. Matthew’s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia, which follows a century-old tradition of helping families who can’t afford Christmas toys for their children. While Sanders’ story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian. She said that such “stories are important because they remind us what this season is all about and that’s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.”Sanders’ message raised eyebrows and comment on social media.skip - Ivanka Trump tweetAnother small but significant sign of change was spotted by former White House aide and former ambassador to Israel Daniel B.

But the tradition of holding a Hanukkah celebration only began during the second Bush administration, so Trump presumably could have gotten away with eliminating it – though that might not have sat well with daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.Indeed, Ivanka Trump’s Twitter feed was one of the clearest indicators that the “return to Merry Christmas” message had not penetrated the culture very deeply.She seemed to quite deliberately choose to wish her five million Twitter followers “Happy Holidays!” with no mention of the “C-word,” in what some viewed as outright defiance of her father’s “War on Christmas” rhetoric.For those who would chalk up Ivanka’s Christmas-less greeting to the fact she is Jewish, there was further evidence of the cultural zeitgeist with the fact her younger brother Eric also stayed ecumenical in wishing the best from Trump Winery.Even Melania Trump’s much publicized – and much maligned – choices for decorating the White House felt more pagan than overtly Christian, with many white branches and relatively few representations of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. Yes, there was a crèche display in the White House, but there had been one throughout the Obama administration, despite false rumors to the contrary.All of this demonstrates the fact that while Trump’s enthusiastic crusade against what he characterizes as a nefarious anti-“Merry Christmas” and pro-“Happy Holidays” conspiracy may play well with his base, his obsession with the issue isn’t at all reflective of mainstream America.That feeling is born out with a newly released Pew Research Center survey, which found that far fewer Americans care about being explicitly wished a “Merry Christmas” than they had in the past.The Pew poll reported: “A rising share of Americans say they do not have a preference about how they are greeted in stores during the holiday season, while a declining percentage prefer to have stores greet them with ‘Merry Christmas.’”skip - Politicization of ChristmasI now no longer know if people wishing me a Merry Christmas want me to have a merry Christmas or fashion themselves aggressive foot soldiers in what they perceive to be the War on Christmas. — Keith Phipps (@kphipps3000) December 23, 2017According to the survey, Americans were previously split down the middle when it came to expressing a preference for “Merry Christmas” over an alternative greeting when they were asked about it more than a decade ago and again in 2012.skip - Feraz Ozel tweet‘My Muslim family has been happy to say Merry Christmas’ — Comedian Feraz Ozel is proving once and for all that the ‘War on Christmas’ doesn’t actually exist pic.twitter.com/Se6dEVvQxJ — NowThis (@nowthisnews) December 22, 2017This year, more than half of the U.S. public surveyed, 52 percent, told pollsters that a business’ choice of holiday greeting did not matter to them, while just a third – 32 percent – said they preferred that stores and businesses greet customers with “Merry Christmas” during the holidays.Overall, the Pew survey pointed to the fact that Trump’s election does not reflect a surge in Christian religiosity in America. In fact, it found the religious aspects of Christmas were markedly “declining.”The number of Americans who believe that the “biblical account of the birth of Jesus depicts actual events” is “shrinking,” it said, and “a declining majority says religious displays such as nativity scenes should be allowed on government property.It’s nothing new for Trump to appeal to his core base, and presumably his “War on Christmas” obsession shores up his status with evangelicals – even as it flies in the face of the sentiments of the majority of Americans, who seem happy to celebrate any holiday and don’t care much how it’s expressed. For many, the politicization of what is supposed to be a greeting of seasonal cheer is simply confusing.In a blow to the “War on Christmas” theory from one of Trump’s least favorite religious minorities, comedian Feraz Ozel compiled video of Muslim-American families wishing their countrymen a Merry Christmas in order to demonstrate that non-Christians were just fine with the phrase.“Plenty of Muslims and brown folks from different religions are still happy to wish you a ‘Merry Christmas’ if the time is right,” Ozel said. “Just because some people say ‘Happy Holidays’ to people who don’t celebrate it doesn’t mean that we’re not happy to wish you a very Merry Christmas also.”",

I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.\n\nRUBIO: For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way.

It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. They're voting out of enthusiasm. They're voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before -- 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old -- never voted before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.\n\nWe're having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we're going to beat them soundly.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nLet's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in -- on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls \"disastrous trade deals\" in order to bring jobs back to America.\n\nGovernor Kasich, I'd like to start with you. You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?\n\nKASICH: Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.\n\nBut my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, \"Oh, America was right,\" and people are out of work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.\n\nBut we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.\n\nTrade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico.\n\nWhy should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, \"generally very much in favor of free trade.\" More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?\n\nRUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.\n\nThe problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.\n\nOn the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?\n\nCRUZ: Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.\n\nAnd the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.\n\nAnd you've got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what's the solution? It's easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.\n\nNumber one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?\n\nRUBIO: If it's being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.\n\nThe second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire -- Disney or some other company hires this company.\n\nWhat they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.\n\nIt is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou've -- in the -- in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.\n\nRUBIO: Correct.\n\nDINAN: Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.\n\nRUBIO: Well first, I think -- well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.\n\nIf there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law. And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not -- what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.\n\nThey are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn't replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, \"lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers\". He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?\n\nKAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.\n\nImmigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we -- I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.\n\nI would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.\n\nAnd I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.\n\nBut let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.\n\nWe can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor\n\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.\n\nTRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\n\nWhen it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of -- and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.\n\nAnd I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.\n\nWe have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things, and we're just -- we're leading with the chin.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nWe're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.\n\nDINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be?\n\nCRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.\n\nAnd the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.\n\nWe're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. Everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power. And the Obama administration has abused executive power.\n\nBeyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.\n\nAnd let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child -- African American, Hispanic -- every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations.\n\nLet me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don't have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, \"We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,\" they're not being honest with you.\n\nSocial Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.\n\nFor example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIf I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now.\n\nThese are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part. So the thing is that my -- my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.\n\nBut again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We're years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.\n\nThat's a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They're leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more.\n\nAnd that's what we're up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.\n\nI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.\n\nTRUMP: And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.\n\nYou have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP...\n\nI mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a -- it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything.\n\nWe've lost our jobs. We've lost everything. We're losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million?\n\nTRUMP: Because they don't cover most of the subjects. We're the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take -- every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.\n\nTRUMP: We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea.

        "article": "Conservative radio talk show host, Laura Ingraham, recently made a statement on Fox News Sunday, suggesting that the widely cited statistic claiming 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases was false. However, fact-checkers have found her claim to be inaccurate.\n\nA number of respected polls conducted in 2015 consistently reveal significant support for expanded background checks for gun purchases. For instance, a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in December 2015 found that 89 percent of respondents supported requiring background checks for people buying guns at gun shows or online. A CBS/New York Times poll from October 2015 showed that 92 percent of respondents favored a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers. Similarly, a Gallup poll conducted in the same month found that 86 percent of respondents favored a law mandating universal background checks for all gun purchases.\n\nThese polls show a strong trend of support for background checks, with results consistently hovering around the 90 percent mark. Pew Research Center's 2015 survey further demonstrated that support for background checks is not limited to specific partisan or demographic groups, and it even extends to a majority of households that own guns.\n\nDespite Ingraham's claim, there is no definitive debunking of the statistic. Some gun rights advocates have contested the survey questions used in these polls, arguing that they refer to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. This distinction may explain why support for general gun control measures does not necessarily translate into support for expanding gun control policies.\n\nWhile people overwhelmingly favor specific gun control policies, such as universal background checks and preventing suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, the support becomes less robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control measures. A CBS/New York Times poll found that 46 percent of Americans believe gun sales laws should either remain the same or be made less strict, while only 51 percent felt the laws should be more strict.\n\nIn conclusion, Ingraham's claim that the 90 percent statistic supporting background checks has been debunked is false. Multiple respected polls from 2015 consistently demonstrate strong support for expanded background checks among Americans. While there may be some dispute over the interpretation of these findings and the level of support for specific legislation, there has been no definitive debunking of the overall statistic.",

Rick Perry's switch from the Democratic to the Republican party years ago puts him in the same company as the nation's 40th president.\n\nPerry revealed in a conversation with Reagan's son, Michael, that he had become a Republican at an earlier age than Ronald Reagan himself. Perry stated, \"I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican, but I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.\"\n\nThe statement prompted a discussion of the ages at which both leaders made their party switch. Reagan, according to historian Edward Yager, was registered as a Democrat when he voted for Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 at the age of 21. Reagan began supporting Republican candidates while still registered as a Democrat, endorsing Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, and Richard Nixon in 1960.\n\nReagan officially registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962 when he was 51 years old. This registration occurred during an event where Reagan was speaking in favor of Nixon's gubernatorial bid in California, and a woman who was a registrar placed a Republican registration card in front of him.\n\nPerry, on the other hand, won his first election as a Democrat in 1984 and served as a Democrat until he switched parties in 1989. Perry made the announcement during a press conference at the age of 39, stating that he intended to continue voting based on his convictions, with the only difference being an 'R' beside his name.\n\nBased on this information, it can be concluded that Perry switched to the Republican party at a younger age than Reagan did. Perry was 39, while Reagan was 51 when they made the switch.\n\nOverall, Perry's statement that he became a Republican at a younger age than Reagan is rated as True.",

        "article": "As anticipated, Texas Governor Rick Perry has officially declared his candidacy for the presidency. It comes as no surprise that his campaign will heavily emphasize faith in miracles. While these miracles may allude to biblical tales, Perry's focus will likely shift to a more secular subject if he secures the Republican nomination – the supposed economic miracle that Texas purportedly experienced during the Great Recession thanks to conservative economic policies. Perry will argue that he can replicate this success on a national scale to restore prosperity to America.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to understand that the so-called Texas miracle is nothing more than a fallacy. Moreover, the Texan experience offers no valuable lessons on how to achieve national full employment.\n\nUndeniably, Texas faced the recession slightly later than the rest of the nation, primarily due to its energy-focused economy benefitting from high oil prices in the initial half of 2008. Additionally, the state was relatively sheltered from the worst impacts of the housing crisis, attributable in part to surprisingly stringent mortgage lending regulations.\n\nWhile these factors contributed to delaying the onset of recession and minimizing the housing crisis's impact, they do not validate Texas' economic policies or suggest their effectiveness in achieving widespread national prosperity. In truth, Texas faces numerous challenges, including inadequate healthcare, high poverty rates, and a lack of economic equity. These issues cannot be ignored in any evaluation of the state's economic performance.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that conservative economic policies alone can be universally applied to revive America's economy is unfounded. Economic conditions, demographics, and social structures vary significantly across states, making a one-size-fits-all policy ineffective.\n\nIt is essential to approach claims of economic miracles with skepticism and a critical eye. While political campaigns often utilize catchy slogans and simplistic narratives, they rarely offer comprehensive solutions to complex issues.",

        "title": "Barack Obama Claims Mitt Romney Condemned Coal-fired Power Plants as \"Killers\"",
        "article": "In a recent campaign rally, Mitt Romney expressed his support for coal miners and their jobs, emphasizing the importance of coal-fired power plants in Ohio and the surrounding areas. Romney argued that the environmental regulations implemented by President Barack Obama's administration could potentially lead to job losses and increased electricity costs for residents of Ohio.\n\nHowever, the Obama campaign quickly responded to Romney's statements, asserting that his position on coal has drastically changed since his time as the governor of Massachusetts. They specifically referenced quotes from Romney in February 2003, shortly after he was elected governor, where he condemned certain coal-fired power plants in Massachusetts, claiming they were responsible for fatalities and posed significant health risks.\n\nThe Obama campaign highlighted three key statements made by Romney during a heated debate over the future of the Salem Harbor Power Station, a coal-burning plant in Boston:\n\n1. \"That plant kills people\" - Romney's reference to Salem Harbor Power Station.\n2. \"I will not create jobs that kill people\" - Romney's commitment to prioritizing public health over job creation.\n3. \"If the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of Massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind. I will always come down on the side of public health\" - Romney's unwavering stance on safeguarding public health.\n\nIt is important to note that Massachusetts had implemented new rules in 2001 to reduce emissions from power plants, including nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury. Salem Harbor Power Station was among the plants singled out as significant polluters, and a Harvard study estimated that it caused various health issues, including premature deaths, emergency room visits, asthma attacks, and upper respiratory symptoms.\n\nWhile some individuals disputed the figures from the Harvard study, claiming they were based on unproven modeling, the study's methodology has since been replicated and is respected by health scientists. Romney, at the time, seemed to accept these findings, as evidenced by his own statements in news releases and his hiring of environmental experts from the Conservation Law Foundation.\n\nTo ascertain the accuracy of the Obama campaign's claim and the severity of Romney's views on coal emissions, experts and environmentalists were consulted. They confirmed that Romney's condemnation of the Salem Harbor plant was part of his wider commitment to emissions reductions, which aligns with the standards later proposed by the U.S. EPA, the same standards Romney now criticizes.\n\nFurthermore, an analysis comparing the emissions levels of Salem Harbor Power Station to those of coal-fired plants in the Midwest revealed that the former had lower or comparable emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, two pollutants known to be hazardous to health. This implies that if one were to support the regulations Romney advocated for in 2003, they would likely also support similar measures on a national scale.\n\nIn conclusion, while Romney made reference to a specific power plant, his comments were part of a broader emissions-reduction initiative that he championed as governor, indicating a consistent viewpoint on coal emissions and public health. Therefore, the Obama campaign's claim about Romney's stance on coal, although focusing on a single plant, holds significant truth based on historical records and contextual analysis.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim made by the Obama campaign rates Mostly True.",

The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)",

The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars.

Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface.

        "article": "In a highly anticipated speech to Congress, former President Barack Obama laid out his vision for a comprehensive health care plan that aims to improve the lives of millions of Americans. Titled \"Making Health Insurance Work for You,\" the plan seeks to address several critical issues faced by individuals and businesses alike.\n\nUnder this proposed plan, insurance companies would no longer be able to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, a significant concern for many Americans. Additionally, the bill, once signed into law, would prohibit insurance companies from terminating coverage when individuals fall sick or reducing coverage when it is needed most. The implementation of arbitrary caps on coverage amounts, both yearly and throughout a lifetime, would also be deemed unlawful.\n\nRecognizing the burden of out-of-pocket expenses, the plan seeks to establish limits on the amount individuals can be charged, ensuring that no American goes bankrupt due to medical bills. Furthermore, routine check-ups and preventive care, such as mammograms and colonoscopies, would be covered by insurance companies at no additional cost. The objective is to detect diseases like breast and colon cancer at an early stage, effectively saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.\n\nFor the tens of millions of Americans currently without health insurance, the second part of the plan promises to offer quality, affordable choices. The proposal introduces a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses can compare and purchase health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies would be incentivized to participate in this exchange to cater to millions of potential customers. This approach aims to mirror the affordable insurance options enjoyed by large companies and government employees.\n\nTo ensure accessibility for those unable to afford the lower-priced insurance available through the exchange, tax credits will be provided based on individual needs. Moreover, all insurance companies seeking access to this new marketplace must abide by consumer protection regulations.\n\nHowever, disregarding the availability of affordable options, there may still be individuals, particularly the young and healthy, who choose to forgo coverage. Likewise, there may be companies that refuse to provide their workers with health care benefits. This irresponsibility has a financial cost for the rest of society. The burden often falls on taxpayers when uninsured individuals require expensive emergency room visits, and it puts businesses providing adequate healthcare at a disadvantage compared to their competitors.\n\nObama urged everyone to do their part, emphasizing that widespread participation is crucial for successful implementation of the proposed insurance reforms. Without a collective effort, crucial elements such as the coverage of pre-existing conditions would be unachievable.\n\nThe former president concluded by pressing on the importance of embracing affordable options for all Americans, emphasizing that access to proper healthcare should not be a luxury but a fundamental right. With this comprehensive plan, he aimed to provide greater security, stability, and opportunity for millions of Americans.",

In a press conference at the Capitol, the California Democrat emphasized that the recent record-high levels of the stock market have not translated into benefits for middle-class workers. Pelosi urged Congress to address this disparity and take action to close the gap.\n\n\nPelosi pointed out, \"This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace, but we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same since the end of the Clinton years.\"\n\n\nHighlighting the need to honor the commitment to the middle class, Pelosi urged Congress to reflect this intention in public policy. She referenced a bill sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), which proposes raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years and indexing future increases to inflation.\n\n\nThe Democrats' bill goes further than President Obama's proposal of increasing the minimum wage to $9 per hour, as outlined in his February State of the Union address. Harkin recently criticized Obama, stating that he \"missed the mark\" with the lower figure.\n\n\nPelosi's plea for a minimum-wage hike coincides with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a historic high of 14,200 points. However, wages, as a percentage of the economy, remain at an all-time low (43.5 percent of GDP last year), and the nation's unemployment rate has stubbornly hovered around 8 percent for the past six months.\n\n\nEconomists attribute the lack of trickle-down benefits from corporate profits to factors such as the increasing productivity of the workforce and companies' hesitancy to hire in a still-unstable economy.\n\n\nThe last time Congress approved a minimum-wage increase was in 2007, as part of a must-pass bill that provided funds for the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was contingent upon including $5 billion in business tax breaks, and it was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.\n\n\nHowever, with the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage increase could harm hiring during a period of job crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill faces an uphill battle in the GOP-controlled House. Nevertheless, Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping that the combination of surging Wall Street gains and stagnating wages for the middle class will resonate with voters.\n\n\nPelosi concluded by saying, \"When we increased it in 2007, it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years. It's time for it to be increased again.\"\n\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://thehill.com/homenews/house/286795-pelosi-urges-minimum-wage-hike",

        "title": "Before leaving governor’s office in 2006, Mitt Romney’s staff eliminated e-mail records",
        "article": "Just before Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governor’s office in 2006, 11 of his top aides purchased their state-issued computer hard drives, and the Romney administration’s e-mails were all wiped from a server, according to records obtained by the Globe. \n\nSecretary of State William F. Galvin, responsible for overseeing the state Public Records Law, said it was odd that state property, such as hard drives, was being sold to private individuals. He emphasized that public officials have an obligation to preserve their records, whether in electronic or paper form. \n\nGalvin also clarified that while the Public Records Law does not explicitly include the governor, e-mails should still be preserved and turned over to the state archivist. The Supreme Judicial Court ruling in 1997 specified that e-mails don't have to be released to the public, but they need to be preserved.\n\nMark Reilly, Chief Legal Counsel for Governor Deval Patrick, explained that the current administration has no electronic record of any Romney administration e-mails. He stated that computers used during that period were replaced and the server was taken out of service, with all files removed from it.\n\nMark Nielsen, Romney’s former chief legal counsel, defended the actions of the governor’s office, stating that employees were given the option to purchase old equipment upon leaving. Nielsen stated that the purchases were in accordance with the law and longstanding executive branch practice. \n\nWhile it appears that Romney administration officials did not violate the letter of the state Public Records Law, Pam Wilmot, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, believes they may have gone against its spirit. She expressed concern that information generated during the administration belongs to the people of the Commonwealth and it seems that the deletion of all records may be a loss for the state.\n\nAlthough Patrick’s office does not have electronic records of the Romney administration's e-mails, there are approximately 700 to 800 boxes of paper records from that era at the state archives in Boston.\n\nThis incident raises parallels to a controversy involving Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston in 2009, when one of his aides deleted almost all of his e-mails from the previous five years. The act was not considered a crime, as the aide was not willfully attempting to hide the correspondence.\n\nIn conclusion, the actions taken by Mitt Romney's staff to eliminate e-mail records and allow aides to purchase computer hard drives upon leaving office have raised concerns about the preservation of public records and transparency in the state government. The debate over the letter versus the spirit of the law continues, with critics arguing that the deletion of records may have resulted in a loss of valuable information.",

        "article": "ber 21, 2010 — -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Welcome to viewers here and around the world. I'm Christiane Amanpour.\n\nAnd at the top of the news this week: nuclear secret, a report of a major advance in North Korea's nuclear program. What new threat does it pose? And how will it impact the president's disarmament agenda and his push to get the Senate to ratify his START nuclear treaty?\n\nOBAMA: This is not about politics. It's about national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: This morning, the nation's top military official, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen. Plus, the escalating war in Afghanistan. His views on night raids, relations with President Karzai, and deadlines for U.S. withdrawal.\n\nThen, hot zone. As Haiti reels from a cholera outbreak, we ask, what happened to the global pledge to rebuild the nation?\n\nAnd G.M.'s new start. Was the bailout good for America after all? Analysis on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, and former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich.\n\nPlus, the Sunday funnies.\n\nLETTERMAN: The Capitol Hill Christmas tree arrives this week. And as soon as it gets to Washington, it will die in committee. Did you know that?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC's \"This Week\" with Christiane Amanpour starts now.\n\nAMANPOUR: Hello again. And with reports of a new nuclear facility in North Korea and a new deadline in the Afghanistan war, there's a lot to discuss with our guest, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen.\n\nPresident Obama returned late last night from the NATO summit in Lisbon where the United States and its allies are now talking about another deadline, the end of 2014 to hand over combat operations to Afghan forces. To make that happen, American and NATO forces are escalating the war right now, and so we start with a powerful report from ABC's Mike Boettcher in Afghanistan.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBOETTCHER (voice-over): When Lieutenant Colonel Steve Lutsky last saw 10-year-old Sadekela (ph), he was bleeding to death on the side of a road.\n\nLUTSKY: His mom was yelling out that, \"My son is dead. My son is dead.\"\n\nBOETTCHER: Now he is recovering at a U.S. military hospital. The lives of the American officer and the Afghan boy intersected on this stretch of highway in Khost province, when a car bomber trying to kill Lutsky and his men attacked their column.\n\n(on-screen): The American convoy was traveling this direction. The other way, civilian vehicles. They slowed down when the convoy passed. So did a suicide bomber. And inside his car, he had 600 pounds of high explosives.\n\n(voice-over): The soldiers were not hurt, but the explosion killed one child and injured three others, including Sadekela (ph). Now angry at the Taliban, Sadekela's (ph) family is grateful to the Americans for saving his life, a small but important victory in a war where not killing civilians is more important than killing the enemy.\n\nTOWNSEND: It buys us credit, in the sense that there's a little more respect for us and there's a little more trust for us.\n\nBOETTCHER: America's top officers tell Afghans that it's the Taliban who are killing civilians, a message undermined by President Karzai's claims that U.S. special operations night raids are killing innocent people.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Nine out of 10 civilian casualties are caused by the Taliban.\n\nBOETTCHER: At a district center in eastern Afghanistan, not everyone is convinced by that argument. During a visit by the 101st Airborne's deputy commander in Afghanistan, Steve Townsend (ph), a village elder asserted that the Americans were killing more Afghans than the Soviets did a quarter century ago. Townsend pushed back hard.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Look in my eyes right now. You know I'm telling the truth.\n\nBOETTCHER: But as the words fly, so do bombs and bullets. Combat Outpost Firra (ph), situated on the Pakistan border, is often attacked. During one assault, 18 insurgents died, but soldiers know this: You can't kill your way out of Afghanistan.\n\n(UNKNOWN): They can reconstitute faster than we can. We're so close to Pakistan that they just come right across the border.\n\nBOETTCHER: So rather than enemy body counts, real success here is measured in how quickly Afghan feet can fill American-made boots. If the war is to end, Afghan soldiers will have to end it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): We have to make a difference. Coming here and -- and just running around and killing the enemy and then leaving and looking back and saying, \"I didn't make a difference, I didn't make a change,\" will cause us to never leave.\n\nBOETTCHER: Steve Lutsky's son is the same age as young Sadekela (ph), 10. The colonel wants only one thing to come from his service here: confidence that his own son someday will not be fighting his father's war.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" Mike Boettcher, ABC News, Forward Operating Base Clark, Afghanistan.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: And joining me now is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen.\n\nWelcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nMULLEN: Good morning.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we will discuss, of course, Afghanistan, but let me get to the breaking news this morning, the report by the New York Times of the discovery of a new nuclear facility in North Korea. How much of a threat is that to the United States, to the world?\n\nMULLEN: Well, this validates a long-standing concern that we've had with respect to North Korea and -- and its enrichment of uranium. It also continues to validate a country that is led by a dictator who is constantly -- who constantly desires to destabilize the region. And he's done that again, certainly, with this capability, as well.\n\nAnd certainly the development of nuclear weapons is a huge concern for all of us, those in the region, as well as those around the globe.\n\nAMANPOUR: How could this have happened in secret, despite the sanctions that were put on? Practically as the sanctions were put on, this was being built.\n\nMULLEN: Well, he's defied sanctions. There are two, actually, U.N. Security Council sanctions that he's defied in this. He's defied what he said he'd do in 2005, because he said he clearly would comply and not -- not do the -- generate this kind of capability, and yet he does.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. But what options, then, do you have? If sanctions are the toughest measure and he's doing it, what's your answer to that?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think we have to continue to bring pressure on him specifically. Those in the region -- in particular the six-party talk countries, Russia, China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, we all -- we have to continue to do that.\n\nHe is predictable in his unpredictability, if you will, because not too long ago, he killed 46 South Korean sailors. He has over time continued to destabilize this region. And, in fact, I also believe that this has to do with a succession plan for his son.\n\nAMANPOUR: But do you think they're planning to make more nuclear weapons? What do you think they're trying to do? And again, if sanctions aren't working, what will?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think we have to continue to bring pressure on him specifically. Those in the region -- in particular the six-party talk countries, Russia, China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, we all -- we have to continue to do that.\n\nHe is predictable in his unpredictability, if you will, because not too long ago, he killed 46 South Korean sailors. He has over time continued to destabilize this region. And, in fact, I also believe that this has to do with a succession plan for his son.\n\nAMANPOUR: But do you think they're planning to make more nuclear weapons? What do you think they're trying to do? And again, if sanctions aren't working, what will?\n\nMULLEN: Well, the assumption certainly is, is that they continue to head in the direction of additional nuclear weapons. And they're also -- they also are known to proliferate this technology.\n\nSo they're a very dangerous country. And -- and he has been someone who has not responded thus far to previous actions. He actually blows hot and cold. He moves in a direction for a while, and then he reverts, and I certainly would see him in his reversion mode at this particular point in time.\n\nAMANPOUR: And why didn't U.S. intelligence discover this?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I won't go into any...\n\nAMANPOUR: But isn't that alarming?\n\nMULLEN: I won't go into any specific intelligence kinds of things today, Christiane, but I would say that, you know, this is something we've been concerned about for a significant period of time, and also penetration of -- of the North Koreans, in terms of intelligence capabilities, is very, very difficult.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think China is the one to help you resolve this?\n\nMULLEN: I think China has...\n\nAMANPOUR: Will it?\n\nMULLEN: ... an awful lot to do with that. We've been engaged with China for an extended period of time with respect to North Korea. The president sent out a team to each of the capitals this weekend to re-engage, and so that's where we are right now, and I'm sure we will continue to do that. And a great part of this, I think, will have to be done through Beijing.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you worried about North Korea making more nuclear weapons right now with this facility? Is that what it's showing?\n\nMULLEN: I've been worried about North Korea and its potential nuclear capability for a long time. This certainly gives that potential real life, very visible life that we all ought to be very, very focused on.\n\nAMANPOUR: The president and the president of Russia have signed the New START treaty. This week, that has been sort of stopped, stopping START in the Senate by the number-two Republican senator there, Jon Kyl.\n\nCan I ask you -- I'm basically going to wave around a veritable \"who's who\" of Republican and Democratic former secretaries of state, of defense, all sorts of people who have been studying this for a long time and say that this has to be ratified. Does it have to be ratified? Is this necessary for U.S. national -- national security?\n\nMULLEN: I think this is -- more than anything else, it's a national security issue. I was involved extensively in the negotiations with my counterpart in Russia. We have for decades have had treaties with them to -- to be able to -- to verify aspects of the nuclear weapons capabilities that we both have. And from a national security perspective, this is absolutely critical.\n\nAMANPOUR: So when it comes to the military impact of this treaty, are you convinced that all the military issues have been dealt with and the United States would be no weaker or a in no worse place if this was ratified?\n\nMULLEN: Completely comfortable with where we are militarily, myself, the rest of the uniformed leadership, as well as the secretary of defense.\n\nAMANPOUR: And the intelligence agencies have signed off on all the verification procedures and measures? You're comfortable with that?\n\nMULLEN: Absolutely. The verification regime that exists in this is in ways better than the one that has existed in the past. Some criticize that there are fewer inspections; the arsenal is much smaller than it used to be. We are close to one year without any ability to verify what's going on in Russia.\n\nAMANPOUR: And you're comfortable with the amount of money that the president and the administration has pledged to modernize American nuclear arsenals?\n\nMULLEN: I have. I reviewed it -- I've reviewed it several times. And it is a very clear commitment to modernize the nuclear infrastructure in this country.\n\nAMANPOUR: So by a process of elimination, is the Senate playing politics with American national security?\n\nMULLEN: Well, you'd have to ask the Senate about that.\n\nAMANPOUR: What do you think?\n\nMULLEN: Well, certainly, what I think is that there is a sense of urgency with respect to ratifying this treaty that needs to be both recognized. Historically this has been bipartisan. This is a national security issue of great significance. And the sooner we get it done, the better.\n\nAMANPOUR: In a lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: As soon as possible.\n\nAMANPOUR: In a lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: Certainly, the potential is there for a lame-duck, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: And you would want that?\n\nMULLEN: I would -- that's the soonest possible time, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: And just so we're clear, why does one need Russia's cooperation today?\n\nMULLEN: I've worked hard, not just in this treaty, with my counterpart in Russia, and I've seen it up and down our government over the course of the last couple of years, and we've really taken significant steps, no better example than this weekend, where President Medvedev was actually in Lisbon with all of NATO supportive of a missile defense treaty -- I'm sorry, missile defense capability in the future. And a year or two ago, that just not would have been possible.\n\nThe Russians have supported us in Afghanistan, allowed us to transport some of our most significant equipment, where they could have pushed back on that.\n\nThey've also helped in other ways that wouldn't be widely known. So the relationship is maturing, very specifically, and it's one that's helped us in Iran. So they've -- so -- so there's been an awful lot tied into the improvement of this relationship.\n\nAMANPOUR: Not ratifying it, does that harm American credibility? For instance, many of the senators who are saying, no, let's not do it in this lame-duck session are the very ones who say we need to make sure that Iran doesn't proliferate nuclear material, we need to make sure, as we've just seen, that North Korea does not. How does this affect America's credibility when it comes to nonproliferation?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think President Obama said coming out of this NATO summit many of the leaders there spoke to him about the need to ratify this New START treaty, and certainly it's indicative of the commitment that many other countries have to us and the importance of getting it done.\n\nSo I'm certainly concerned about how -- and in particular, how we look and also this -- this emerging relationship with Russia and what it would mean to not do that. And they've clearly sent signals already with respect to that which haven't been positive.\n\nAMANPOUR: What signals?\n\nMULLEN: Just -- they've spoken to the need to get this done, the importance of it, and whether or not it would be tied to this relationship, given all that we've done in the course of the last couple of years.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's move on to Afghanistan, an area where you said that they have been cooperating. They've just said that they're going to offer more roots through their -- through their territory for material for NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nIn NATO, summit in Lisbon, talking now about a 2014 deadline for transferring combat responsibilities to the Afghan forces. I've also heard -- is that an absolute date?\n\nMULLEN: Yes, it is.\n\nAMANPOUR: Absolute?\n\nMULLEN: Yes, it is. It's one everybody signed up to.\n\nAMANPOUR: All combat operations will be handed over to Afghans at the end of 2014?\n\nMULLEN: I would describe it much like what we just went through in Iraq, where clearly they have the lead for their own security. We are then in some capacity, in a training, advising, and assist mode, which we would expect to be for some time, but in terms of combat operations, they would have the lead.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you see post-2014 just like we see in Iraq today?\n\nMULLEN: As best we can tell, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: Any more?\n\nMULLEN: Any more...\n\nAMANPOUR: ... troops, operations. I mean, I ask you, because right now, how many areas have even been transferred to Afghan control?\n\nMULLEN: Well, one of the things that happened -- one of the things that happened in Lisbon was the commitment to start to -- that transfer in the spring, and that will be based on conditions on the ground and a recommendation from General Petraeus, literally district by district. So it's a significant commitment to start that this spring.\n\nAgain, it really is a situation where -- where the Afghans then lead, specifically in terms of their own security, and we think that's absolutely critical, and that they'll be capable of starting to be able to do that this spring.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, your own officers say, in fact, even in the least combative areas of Afghanistan, that it could take something like 18 months to 24 months to complete a transfer to Afghan lead, in terms of security. Can they really, do you believe, take over security within four years?\n\nMULLEN: I do believe, as best we understand things right now, that that's very much a reachable goal. There's a lot to do between now and then, clearly. Very dangerous place, very tough fight we're in right now. We certainly understand that.\n\nBut that's a goal actually that President Karzai set out there and that all NATO allies -- actually, all countries who are providing forces -- because there are some 20 other countries doing that -- have signed up to, and we think it's reachable.\n\nAMANPOUR: In order to do that, it looks like the situation on the ground is shifting. In other words, that there is a huge spike in raids, whether it be drones on the Pakistan area, whether it be trying to kill as many Taliban as possible on the ground in Afghanistan. Is that what's happening now?\n\nMULLEN: We knew this year would be a particularly difficult year because of all the added troops that we put in, among other things. And it has been. And I would expect next year to be a very difficult year, as well.\n\nThat said, the -- the security situation has started to change. It has started to get better -- better. We've sacrificed greatly, tragic losses, far too many always, but we've also succeeded in starting to reverse the momentum. I think General Petraeus calls it we've arrested the momentum in some specific places...\n\nAMANPOUR: But he said it's not irreversible.\n\nMULLEN: No, it isn't irreversible, and it's still fragile. That's really where we are right now in this fight.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, given that fact, as you put it, what is the relationship with President Karzai, which seems to be basically all over the place on any given day? What does he say now about night raids?\n\nMULLEN: Well, he's -- I think, obviously, most recently, he's spoken to his concerns about that. The piece that you ran earlier speaks to a huge issue, which is the issue of civilian casualties, but it also speaks to a point that was -- is oftentimes not clearly articulated, which is the Taliban are killing about 9 or 10 times more civilians than -- than our forces are. And we are making extraordinary efforts to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\nWe recognize President Karzai's concern with respect to night raids and some of the other concerns that he has, and we are doing all we can. There has to be a balance here, very specifically.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me move quickly over to Yemen. Al Qaida brazenly puts out a statement today, yesterday saying that this is our tactic, bombs that cost $4,000-plus, a raid against all your multibillions of security in counterterrorism. Are they going to succeed with one of these cargo plane bombs?\n\nMULLEN: Well, there's an awful lot of effort going on to make sure that they don't. And...\n\nAMANPOUR: Doesn't that worry you?\n\nMULLEN: You bet it worries me. And I give credit to a lot of people to -- at this point in time that -- that they haven't been able to pull something like this off, because it's a very serious threat, and I believe what they are saying. They've grown, it's dangerous, and it's a place we need to focus.\n\nAMANPOUR: \"Don't ask/don't tell,\" something that's hugely important right now. A draft report has come to you; some 70 percent of the military say that it will either have a beneficial or nonexistent effect. Do you think it needs to be voted on in this lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I won't speak to what the draft report says. We'll have this report done here...\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think...\n\nMULLEN: ... and to Secretary Gates in the next couple of weeks, by December 1st, and I won't make any comments on where I think we need to go until that report is done.\n\nAMANPOUR: You support it, though, repealing \"don't ask/don't tell\"?\n\nMULLEN: From my personal perspective, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: Because?\n\nMULLEN: Because I think it -- it belies us as an institution. We value integrity as an institution.\n\nAMANPOUR: You mean forcing them to lie about what they are?\n\nMULLEN: And then -- and then asking individuals to come in and lie about who they are every day goes counter to who we are as an institution.\n\nAMANPOUR: Apart from the integrity issue, many of your allies -- whether it be England or Canada or France or Australia, the Israeli army -- they have openly gay servicemembers in their military with no adverse effects.\n\nMULLEN: Certainly. I've seen that, and that is very much a part of this review, and we'll incorporate that into the review and recommendations which go up the chain.\n\nAMANPOUR: So were you angry with the new Marine commandant when he cast his own doubts over this and criticized it?\n\nMULLEN: He had made his position very clear in testimony. What concerned me about his most recent comments, it came at a time where we actually had the draft report in hand, and we had all agreed that we would speak to this privately until we completed the report and made our recommendations up the chain.\n\nAMANPOUR: And if it does not get voted on in the lame-duck session, is there any chance that it will come up in any reasonable time period afterwards?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I mean, it's very hard to predict what's going to happen. Obviously, from a legislative...\n\nAMANPOUR: But would you think it will put it down the road?\n\nMULLEN: ... from a legislative perspective. The other piece that is out there that's very real is the courts are very active on this. And my concern is that at some point in time the courts could change this law and in that not give us the right amount of time to implement it. I think it's much better done -- if it's going to get done, it's much better done through legislature than it is out of the courts.\n\nAMANPOUR: Admiral Mullen, thank you very much indeed for joining us.\n\nMULLEN: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: And the roundtable is next, with George Will, Robert Reich, Donna Brazile, and Ed Luce from the Financial Times.\n\nAnd also, later, a report from Haiti on the cholera outbreak. Has the country been abandoned again?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n(UNKNOWN): Whoa.\n(UNKNOWN): Yes. Pull. Dang it.\n(UNKNOWN): Missed it.\n(UNKNOWN): Bristol the Pistol, you fired a few blanks during the week, but tonight all guns blazing.\n\nWALTERS: If you ran for president, could you beat Barack Obama?\nPALIN: I believe so.\nBIDEN: She's always underestimated, so, you know, I think -- I think I shouldn't say any more.\n(UNKNOWN): There you go.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: A big week for Sarah Palin, one of the topics for our roundtable with George Will, Robert Reich, author of \"Aftershock: The Next Economy and America's Future,\" Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, and Ed Luce of the Financial Times.\n\nAnd I want to start with our interview with Mike Mullen. We're clearly going to get to Sarah Palin. What do you think? Admiral Mullen could barely be constrained from saying that he thought this was political, this holdup.\n\nREICH: I thought it was very interesting, Christiane. I mean, when you asked him that question, he was very, very tempted -- you could almost read his mind -- to say that, look, Jon Kyl is taking direction from Mitch McConnell, who says explicitly that the next two years are going to be about making sure that Barack Obama is not a two-term president. And, therefore, this is all politics, and therefore, the Republicans are putting politics above national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, on an issue like this, they can't do that, can they? I mean, really, he ticked off the military, the intelligence, the financial; all the questions that they had have been resolved.\n\nWILL: I take Jon Kyl at his word, and I respect him very much. I think what he says is, first of all, it's nonsense to say, as Joe Biden, the gift who keeps on giving does say, that it is -- the vital national security interest of the United States is to ratify this in a lame-duck session? That means that if we didn't have a lame-duck session, which we shouldn't do ever, the nation would be...\n\nAMANPOUR: But the vital interest is to ratify it right now, as soon as possible.\n\nWILL: As opposed to six weeks from now? Oh, please.\n\nAMANPOUR: But it -- but it looks like it would be put off, even if it was -- they want more debate. They want to reopen it, talk about it again.\n\nWILL: Jon Kyl is bargaining for the modernization of our nuclear force.\n\nAMANPOUR: So it's about money?\n\nWILL: Can I give you -- that's part -- it's about the modernization of our force. Can I give you Will's law of arms control? Arm's control is impossible until it's unimportant. This is unimportant, so it's going to get done. That is, who lies awake at night worrying about the size, not the security, but the size of the Russian nuclear arsenal? No one.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you're partly right there, because the size is not the main issue. It's the verification, which is a huge issue, and, vitally, American credibility. Here we have this story from North Korea today -- how does America stand up and say, \"You guys can't proliferate,\" if we're not going to do this? How can we lead?\n\nLUCE: Very, very difficult. I mean, Russia, of course, is a part of the six-party group with North Korea, and therefore its cooperation is also important there, as it is on Afghanistan, as it is on Iran.\n\nThese broader implications for failing to ratify START here go across the world. Russia's cooperation is something that Obama has worked on very successfully, very patiently, along with Hillary Clinton, for two years now, and this puts it in jeopardy.\n\nJust one other point, though, about Mitch McConnell's pledge to make Obama a one-term president. Clearly, that's going to be the strategy of the Republicans. Question is, are they going to do it intelligently or unintelligently? And I think Senator Kyl, his comments and his stance, indicate it could well be the latter.\n\nBRAZILE: Senator Kyl a year ago, after returning from Geneva, called upon the Senate to quickly ratify this treaty. Now, what has happened in one year? What has happened, clearly, is that the Republicans have redoubled their efforts to block anything that President Obama would like to see passed. They want to deny him a victory.\n\nThis is political malpractice. And Senator Kyl said that himself. So it might be -- George is probably correct. This might be about money, to get more money for the nuclear industry complex. The president has promised $4 billion more, but in all...\n\nAMANPOUR: In addition to $80 billion.\n\nBRAZILE: That's right. But in all of the hearings this year and all of the conversations, Senator Kyl, no one else, you know, expressed any objections, and now this is, I think, one of those political moments where they can succeed in blocking the president.\n\nREICH: You know, there were 21 separate hearings and briefings. I mean, this is not something that is being put suddenly on the agenda. And for Kyl to say right now we just don't have time or this is -- there's not enough money I think defies logic.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, again, as Admiral Mullen said, it's not just a nice treaty with a foreign country. It is about Russia's cooperation on all the issues that the United States needs, whether it's Afghanistan, Iran, and all the rest of it.\n\nPlus, I don't know what you think, but some are saying that this could give rise to the hard-liners in Russia again, who just do not want to -- who just don't want to deal with the United States.\n\nLUCE: Oh, absolutely. I think it's -- it's a dream -- if you picked two countries that would like to see a failure of ratification, it would be North Korea and Iran. And I think that -- if that argument doesn't work with the Republicans, that sort of basic elemental national security argument doesn't work, nothing is. There's -- there's a greater hatred of Obama than there is a love of American national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's switch right back to here and economic security. G.M. today this week had success, initial public offering. The bailout worked? The saving G.M. worked?\n\nREICH: Well, it worked, Christiane, to the extent that, indeed, G.M. is now worth $50 billion, if you believe the stock market, and before, in the old G.M., was worth $25 billion.\n\nBut what happened during the bailout? Actually, it was a -- it -- it was not so much a bailout as it was a reorganization under bankruptcy, and they got rid of $80 billion of debt, they got rid of thousands of jobs, divisions that were not functioning. Wall Streeters came in and reorganized G.M.\n\nWhy do we suppose the exact same thing would not have happened under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reorganization? It's not clear that the $50 billion of taxpayer money was necessary.\n\nWILL: Of course, we'll get it back, unless their share price goes to $55 and they sell 500 million shares of the stock.\n\nDon't believe a word G.M. says. Remember that last April their CEO, in an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, and then echoing in television commercials, said G.M. has paid back the bailout in full. It paid back a tiny sliver of it, and it paid it back with government funds from another account. So do not listen to G.M.\n\nAMANPOUR: Don't listen to a word G.M. says?\n\nLUCE: I -- I find that difficult to disagree with. I would, however, say just in defense of the Treasury's handling of this IPO that there is not an IPO in the world that -- not a privatization in the world that isn't controversial, that hasn't been criticized for being underpriced or overpriced or misallocated. And in this case, clearly, they're going to have to see an increase in the share price to get the taxpayer money fully back.\n\nBRAZILE: We saved a critical part of the American manufacturing base, and that's -- that's good news during this Thanksgiving week.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, indeed, Warren Buffett, who knows a bit about business, has written an op-ed this last week to -- \"To Uncle Sam, thank you from your grateful nephew, Warren, for actually saving the economy.\" Do you give the administration any credit for that?\n\nREICH: Yes, certainly. And the economy would be much worse were it not for everything the administration has done. But, again, it's hard to prove a negative. It's very, very difficult right now.\n\nWe look at the degree of anger and upset still there in the American economy, on Main Street. The Washington Post ran a survey not long ago showing that 53 percent of homeowners -- 53 percent -- are worried about paying their mortgage.\n\nNow, this may be a good economy for Wall Street, it may be a good economy for the IPOs, it may be a good economy for the people in the top 1 percent whose assets are in financial instruments, but this is not a good economy yet for most people.\n\nAMANPOUR: The economy is showing still slow signs of coming back. The job numbers keep getting incrementally better, but not enough to affect the 9.6 percent. Was it -- is it -- is it actually going to help?\n\nLUCE: The G.M. IPO? Well, I mean, I think...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, and the -- and the -- the measures, as Warren Buffett said, that helped keep the economy from diving.\n\nLUCE: Yes, but they're all in the system. They're out there. Nothing more other than what Ben Bernanke and the Fed is doing is going to be available in this political climate. And whether that will be enough to help, I think there are grounds for deep skepticism. I do think we're looking at a Japan-style situation here of low growth or at least the threat of that.\n\nOne thing I'd say about the G.M. IPO, just to back up Donna, is the counterfactual here. If G.M. had been -- had gone bankrupt and large portions of it had been closed down, we could have lost several hundred thousand jobs. The exaggerated number of 1 million might be too high.\n\nThe administration's communications effort on this has been absolutely abysmal. It's quite extraordinary to me how they haven't put this forward more forcefully and -- and how the public still doesn't see just how different a kind of bailout this was than the Wall Street bailouts, which remain deservedly unpopular.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me just play what Warren Buffett told us about taxes. Obviously, this is going to come up in this session of Congress, the Bush-era taxes, which either have to be extended or not. This is what he said .

        "article": "Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.",

Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty Images\"Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,\" Damron said in a emailed statement.Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a \"riskier\" forms of collateral, according to court documents.However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife.

        "article": "nt:  \nFor weeks, construction workers from Latin America have been diligently working on the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington, proud to be building one of the city's newest luxury hotels. However, tensions have risen on the job site after billionaire developer Donald Trump, the man behind the project, made controversial comments about illegal immigration while launching his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. This has left some of the workers concerned about their job security and others disgusted by the opinions of the man responsible for creating those jobs.\n\nAccording to several workers at the site, it is possible that some of the construction workers, who are undocumented immigrants, were hired by a Trump company to finish the $200 million hotel. While a Trump spokeswoman has stated that the company and its contractors abide by all applicable laws, the workers are now worried about the repercussions of Trump's comments. They argue that they have lived honest lives, worked hard, and contributed to the local community, including buying homes and raising U.S.-born children.\n\nSeveral of the laborers, who come from countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, have become U.S. citizens or obtained legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly admitted that they remain in the country illegally.\n\nThe concern among the workers is that Trump's comments could escalate into a bigger problem and potentially lead to their termination. Some workers even expressed the fear of being told to \"get the heck out of here\" by Trump himself. They argue that they risk their lives and health on the job site, and Trump's comments do not accurately reflect their hard work and dedication.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, emphasized that the company and its contractors follow all immigration laws when hiring workers. She also stated that the obligation to check the workers' status lies with the lead contractor, Lend Lease, who is responsible for hiring subcontractors for the project.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Trump's comments and his stance on illegal immigration highlights the complexity of the issue. While his remarks resonated with conservative voters, they have also led to backlash from the general electorate and businesses that are concerned about alienating the Latino community. Trump's comments have already resulted in severed ties with corporations such as NBC and Macy's.\n\nAt the construction site, workers continue with their responsibilities despite the tension. Many of them expressed their disagreement with Trump's comments and emphasized that they are hardworking individuals striving to build a better life for their families. They believe that their contribution to society and their commitment to their jobs make them more American than Trump himself.",

        "article": "U.S.-UNITED KINGDOM RELATIONS\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have a long-standing alliance, with no closer ally than each other. Dating back to the end of the American Revolution in 1783, the United Kingdom was one of the first countries to officially recognize American independence. Diplomatic relations were established in 1785, and apart from a brief break during the War of 1812, the two nations have remained steadfast partners and allies. This partnership forms the foundation for mutual prosperity and security.\n\nThe strong relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is rooted in their shared democratic ideals and values. Cooperation between the two countries extends to political, security, and economic issues. Together with other European allies, the United States and the United Kingdom work closely to combat terrorism, prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and ensure regional security. Both nations also coordinate efforts to address destabilizing actions by Moscow, including the war against Ukraine, election interference, cyberattacks, the use of chemical weapons, support of corrupt proxies, and human rights violations. In September 2021, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom signed the Australia, United Kingdom, and United States (AUKUS) security partnership agreement, which further solidifies security cooperation among allies.\n\nThe United States actively supports the peace process and devolved political institutions in Northern Ireland. It encourages the implementation of the 1998 Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement, which was brokered by the United States.\n\nIn addition to political and security cooperation, the United States and the United Kingdom maintain strong educational, cultural, and professional exchange programs, which further strengthen the historic bonds between the two nations. The United Kingdom is a popular study abroad destination for American students, and over 8,000 UK students studied in the United States during the 2020/21 academic year. The Fulbright Program, established in 1948, has facilitated exchanges between the United States and the United Kingdom, benefiting more than 27,000 scholars, students, and teachers. Privately funded exchange programs also bring around 17,500 UK citizens to the United States annually.\n\nU.S. assistance to the United Kingdom includes contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (IFI). This funding supports projects that sustain the peace process and encourage cross-community engagement and economic opportunities in Northern Ireland (UK) and the border counties of Ireland. The U.S. government has provided over $549 million to the IFI since its establishment in 1986.\n\nEconomically, the United States and the United Kingdom share a vibrant trade relationship, with mutual trade and investment at the core of their prosperity. Despite the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union in 2020, the United States continues to be a strong partner, focusing on advancing international trade priorities based on shared values and promoting inclusive economic growth and innovation for workers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. With the United States and the United Kingdom being the first and fifth largest economies in the world by GDP respectively, their bilateral trade in goods and services exceeded $273 billion in 2019. The two-way direct investment between the nations totals over $1.3 trillion.\n\nNotably, every U.S. state has jobs connected to UK investments, with nearly 1.3 million Americans employed by UK companies in the United States, and over 1.5 million Britons directly employed by U.S. firms. Key U.S. exports to the United Kingdom include precious metals, aircraft, machinery, financial and travel services, as well as agricultural products such as wine and beer.\n\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom take leadership roles in combating climate change. They are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United States aims to reduce emissions by 50-52 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, while the United Kingdom has set an ambitious target of slashing emissions by 78 percent by 2035. As host of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021, the United Kingdom actively collaborated with the United States and other nations to secure international commitments that enhance climate action and protect the world from the impacts of climate change.\n\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom are prominent members of various international organizations. They are two out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and are founding members of NATO. Additionally, they belong to organizations like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), G-20, G-7, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization. The United Kingdom, as a top contributor to NATO, plays a significant role in strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities against modern threats. It leads key NATO efforts in areas such as cyber defense and emerging technologies, and serves as a Framework Nation for the Enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia. The United Kingdom also has observer status in the Organization of American States and is a Dialogue Partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nIn conclusion, the United States and the United Kingdom share an exceptional alliance that has endured for over two centuries. Their relationship is grounded in democratic values and extends across political, security, economic, educational, and cultural domains. As close partners and allies, they work together to address global challenges, promote peace and prosperity, and protect the interests of their citizens.",

While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com",

        "article": "As the hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders continues to grow, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting that the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut. CNN's Jake Tapper brought up this issue in an interview with Sanders on July 5, alluding to an attack ad by a pro-Martin O'Malley group that claimed Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which included background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases.\n\nThe Brady Act, which became a landmark piece of gun control legislation, mandated a five-day waiting period for anyone wanting to buy a handgun while local law enforcement conducted criminal background checks. Before the bill became law, it underwent several transformations. Sanders, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it multiple times, almost always in opposition.\n\nIn May 1991, Sanders voted against a version of the bill that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House. The Senate later decreased the waiting period to five days, and in November 1991, Sanders again voted against that version. Although it passed in the House, it did not receive enough votes in the Senate. The bill remained in limbo during 1992.\n\nAfter several amendments, a version of the bill was reintroduced that reinstated the five-day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders once again voted against that version but voted for an amendment that imposed an instant background check instead (although the technology for instant checks did not exist at the time). He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods but voted for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.\n\nThe final compromise version of the Brady bill, which included an interim five-day waiting period while an instant background check system was installed, was passed and signed into law on November 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.\n\nSanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, explained that Sanders opposed the Brady bill for two reasons. First, he believed that a national waiting period was federal overreach. Second, he was representing the will of the people of Vermont.\n\nSanders' home state, Vermont, has a high gun ownership rate and lenient gun control laws. Sanders' voting record on guns reflects the preferences of his constituents, as well as his own personal views.\n\nExperts agree that Sanders' stance on guns is more moderate compared to his Democratic rivals. While he advocates for more gun regulation than the current U.S. policies, he recognizes the preferences of his constituents and does not prioritize gun control as a key issue.\n\nOverall, the claim made in the attack ad that Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill and background checks and waiting periods is mostly true. Sanders did vote against the bill multiple times, but he also voted in favor of an amendment that included an instant background check and against repealing state background checks.",

        "article": "The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women.",

        "article": "President Donald Trump has just signed an executive order stripping the National Football League (NFL) of its \"non-profit\" status. The executive order is aimed at businesses that benefit from tax exemptions despite earning billions of dollars in annual revenue.\n\nThe NFL has long enjoyed its non-profit status, but now it seems that the president has had enough. The league that makes billions of dollars each year from television contracts, merchandise sales, and ticket sales will now be subject to regular business taxes.\n\nThis move by the president is not surprising considering his previous criticism of the league during his time in office. Trump has publicly criticized the NFL for allowing players to kneel during the national anthem and for not punishing them enough.\n\nThe move will have a significant impact on the NFL's bottom line, as it will now have to pay taxes on all its revenue. It's unclear how much the league stands to lose by this decision, but its finances will undoubtedly be impacted.\n\nIn response to the executive order, the NFL released a statement saying, \"We are disappointed by the decision made by the president. We will continue to operate as a business and fulfill our obligations to our fans and affiliates.\"\n\nMany NFL fans have voiced their support of the president's decision, saying that the league needs to be held accountable for its actions and that it should not be treated as a non-profit organization.\n\nOverall, this executive order marks a significant shift in how the NFL will be treated by the federal government. The league will now be subject to the same taxes as any other business, and it may need to adjust its financial strategies accordingly.",

        "title": "Pastors To Protest IRS Rules on Political Advocacy",
        "article": "On September 28, pastors from 20 states will take part in a protest organized by the Alliance Defense Fund (ADF), a conservative legal-advocacy group. The protest aims to challenge an Internal Revenue Code restriction that limits the political activities of charitable organizations, including churches and religious groups, that are exempt from taxation. The restriction dictates that religious groups may lose their tax-exempt status if they officially endorse a political candidate. The ADF intends to bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these penalties if the protest leads to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) action against houses of worship.\n\nTo shed light on the ADF protest and IRS restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, the Pew Forum turned to church-state scholar Robert W. Tuttle, the David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion at The George Washington University Law School. \n\nInterviewer: Jesse Merriam, Research Associate, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life\n\n--\n\nQuestion & Answer\n\nQ: Before 1954, nonprofit organizations were allowed to endorse political candidates under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. What prompted Congress to add the restriction that now exists?\n\nA: The motivations behind Congress' decision to add the restriction in 1954 are not entirely clear. It is believed that concerns were raised about nonprofit organizations funding their opponents' political campaigns. However, as the amendment primarily targeted political contributions, rather than limiting political advocacy, its original purpose is often misconstrued.\n\nQ: Why is the Alliance Defense Fund advocating for the elimination of this restriction?\n\nA: The ADF opposes the restriction as it forces churches to choose between active political participation and accepting tax-deductible donations. If a church wants to support or oppose a specific political candidate, it would need to establish a separate organization to do so. Although this new organization would be tax-exempt, donations made to it would not be eligible for tax deductions. The ADF believes that this restriction hampers the essential role of political activity within a congregation's life. Furthermore, they argue that the IRS's enforcement of the rule, including the examination of sermons and religious messages, oversteps the boundaries between government and religion.\n\nQ: If the ADF's protest leads to a constitutional challenge, what arguments might they present in court?\n\nA: In the event of a constitutional challenge, the ADF would likely argue that the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, as it places stricter regulations on religious organizations compared to their secular counterparts. They may also contend that the amendment violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a federal statute that prohibits the government from imposing significant burdens on religious organizations without demonstrating a compelling government interest. Additionally, the ADF could argue that the restriction violates the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause, which bars content-based regulation of speech. Lastly, they might claim that IRS enforcement of the amendment infringes upon the First Amendment's Establishment Clause by necessitating the examination of sermons and religious messages, thus entangling the government with religious operations.\n\nQ: How might the government defend the 1954 amendment?\n\nA: The government would likely defend the amendment by asserting that it treats religious organizations in the same manner as other charitable and educational organizations. Moreover, they would argue that the restriction does not prevent congregations from participating in campaigns; it only restricts donors from making tax-deductible political contributions. They would also contend that the restriction does not violate the Free Speech Clause as it only withholds a speech subsidy rather than outright restricting speech. In response to the Establishment Clause argument, the government would argue that there is no excessive entanglement of government and religion since the IRS does not assess the theological merit of sermons but rather examines if they promote political candidates.\n\nQ: How do you foresee a court evaluating these arguments?\n\nA: Predicting how a court would decide a hypothetical case is challenging, as decisions are often dependent on specific case facts. However, looking at past precedent, it is likely that a court would uphold the constitutionality of the 1954 amendment's application to religious organizations. In Branch Ministries v. Rossotti (2000), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the amendment. The court argued that the amendment did not violate the Free Exercise or Free Speech clauses since the congregation remained free to engage in political speech and activities. This decision was influenced by previous Supreme Court cases, Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983) and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization (1990), which upheld the monetary benefit provided by 501(c)(3) status and the principle that a tax applied equally to both religious and nonreligious organizations does not impose substantial burdens on religious exercise.\n\nQ: If the 1954 amendment was lifted for religious organizations but not for other charitable organizations, would that pose an issue under the First Amendment's Establishment Clause?\n\nA: This is a complex question with no definitive answer. Courts typically uphold legislative efforts that alleviate burdens on religious activity, even if the burdens do not meet the \"substantial burden\" requirement under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). While courts might be inclined to defer to Congress's judgment to exempt religious organizations from the restriction, they may also view a religion-specific exemption as favoring religious entities over non-religious ones. In the case of Texas Monthly v. Bullock (1989), the Supreme Court deemed a sales tax exemption for religious publications as a violation of the Establishment Clause since it effectively subsidized religious publications. The current Supreme Court, which holds a narrower view of the Establishment Clause, might rule differently than the Texas Monthly decision. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the composition and interpretation of the court at the time.",

He also thanked Mia, who gave a spirited introduction before his speech.\n\nPresident Obama took a moment to interact with the crowd, expressing his love for the Secret Service and jokingly responding to an audience member's declaration of love. He then praised the Michigan-made cars, particularly the new Mustangs, comparing them favorably to the cars he typically rides in as President.\n\nThe President proceeded to highlight the positive developments in the American auto industry. He emphasized the fact that 2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s and that the United States has had a 57-month streak of private sector job creation. He also mentioned that American manufacturing is experiencing its best stretch of job growth since the 1990s, with Michigan alone adding over 100,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nPresident Obama credited the steps taken early on to rescue and rebuild the economy for the current state of progress. He highlighted that the American auto industry, which had faced severe challenges, was now back on track. He mentioned that Ford, in particular, had not only survived but thrived, creating thousands of new jobs.\n\nThe President commended the partnership between labor and management in the auto industry, emphasizing that shared sacrifice and responsibility were key to its success. He noted that Ford had rejected the false choice of prioritizing shareholders over workers and had managed to benefit both parties. President Obama reaffirmed his belief that America is at its best when everyone is working together for the greater good.\n\nThe President then discussed the positive impact of the auto industry's recovery on the middle class. He stated that the industry's resurgence proved that any comeback is possible and that American manufacturing has a future. He acknowledged the challenges that both Detroit and the industry still face but expressed confidence in their ability to overcome those obstacles.\n\nBefore concluding the speech, President Obama shared the inspiring story of a veteran named Ramone, who found employment at Ford after struggling to secure a job upon returning from military service. The President used Ramone's story as an example of the American spirit of resilience and determination.\n\nIn his final remarks, President Obama reassured the audience that he would continue to support the revival of American industries and the middle class. He expressed his commitment to working alongside the hardworking men and women of the auto industry to ensure a prosperous future for America.\n\nThe President's visit to the Michigan Assembly Plant highlights the remarkable recovery of the American auto industry and serves as a testament to the hard work and dedication of its workers.",

Rubio claimed that Cruz had voted for a budget proposal by Rand Paul that included defense cuts greater than those proposed by Barack Obama.\n\nTo fact-check Rubio's claim, we looked into Cruz's 2013 vote in favor of Rand Paul's budget proposal. Only 18 Republican senators, including Cruz, voted in favor of the amendment, which ultimately failed. Paul's proposal aimed to reduce non-war defense spending and realign the military for the 21st century, but it still resulted in an increase in defense appropriations from 2014 to 2023.\n\nRubio's campaign considered Paul's budget as a cut to defense spending because it sought to reduce the size and scope of the military. Experts, however, argue that the budget proposal was not a true cut but rather a slower rate of increase compared to other Republican proposals and the president's budget. It should be noted that Paul's proposal for defense was still below Obama's request.\n\nFurthermore, Cruz's vote in favor of a Rubio amendment in March to boost defense spending contradicts Rubio's claim that Cruz only supported cuts. Although Rubio's larger point regarding Cruz's stance on defense may have been undermined by this vote, it does not make Rubio entirely wrong.\n\nIn light of these findings, we rate Rubio's statement as Mostly False.",

More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyoncé, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of \"Scandal.\"On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best .

        "article": "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",

        "article": "In a recent Medium post, Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate, made a significant claim regarding gun violence and its impact on minority youth. According to Clinton, gun violence surpasses the next nine causes of death combined for young African-American men.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of this statement, we delved into the data available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. Through the CDC's search form, we obtained information on the ten most common causes of death for African-American males aged 15 to 24 in 2014.\n\nWhen considering gun-related homicides alone, the data revealed 2,256 deaths in this category, compared to 2,119 deaths in the subsequent nine leading causes combined. Therefore, Clinton's statement holds true based on these figures.\n\nMoreover, if we include accidents and suicides involving guns, the gap widens even further. In total, there were 2,533 gun-related deaths across all ten categories, contrasted with 2,002 deaths caused by other factors.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the accuracy of Clinton's statement relies on the chosen age range. Specifically, for African-American boys aged 10 to 14, the statement does not hold true. In 2014, there were 38 gun-related homicides, 10 gun suicides, and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, amounting to a total of 51 deaths. Conversely, for that age and racial group, the top ten causes of death accounted for 271 deaths unrelated to firearms, such as diseases.\n\nNonetheless, considering Clinton's use of the age range of 15 to 24 for defining \"young,\" it appears to be a reasonable choice.\n\nIn conclusion, based on data from the CDC, Hillary Clinton's statement that \"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined\" is accurate within the defined age range of 15 to 24. Therefore, we rate her statement as True.",

        "article": "In a press conference held in the Rose Garden, President Obama expressed his disappointment in the Senate's recent decision to block common-sense gun reforms, including expanded background checks. He stated that 90 percent of Americans support universal background checks, which would prevent dangerous individuals, such as convicted felons and those with severe mental illnesses, from purchasing firearms.\n\nThe President acknowledged that no single piece of legislation can prevent all acts of violence and evil, but emphasized that if even one life could be saved through these measures, it was the duty of Congress to act. He commended Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their bipartisan efforts in crafting a compromise that respected both Second Amendment rights and the need for stricter background checks.\n\nHowever, despite the majority of Senators voting in favor of the proposed legislation, a minority was able to block its progression. President Obama attributed this obstruction to the fear of potential political backlash from the gun lobby and its allies. He criticized the spreading of unfounded claims and lies about the bill, such as the creation of a gun registry, as tactics that influenced a vocal minority and intimidated senators who caved to pressure.\n\nThe President highlighted the families of gun violence victims, who had lobbied for this legislation, as an important voice in the debate. He dismissed critics who referred to them as \"emotional blackmail\" and emphasized their right to participate in the discussion due to their personal experiences.\n\nPresident Obama vowed to continue working to protect communities from gun violence, even without Congress' support. He outlined plans to address barriers preventing states from participating in the existing background check system, provide law enforcement with more information about lost and stolen guns, and improve emergency plans for schools.\n\nIn concluding, President Obama encouraged the American people to remain passionate and organized in pushing for common-sense gun legislation. He urged them to hold their representatives accountable and make their voices heard, stating that change would only come from sustained effort and active participation.\n\nThe President emphasized that the fight for stricter gun control measures was far from over, and pledged to continue working towards protecting American citizens from gun violence. He expressed his belief that the memories of the children lost in tragic shootings, such as Newtown, would inspire the country to achieve meaningful change.\n\nThe press conference highlighted the President's commitment to preventing future gun-related tragedies and his disappointment in the Senate's failure to pass legislation that had overwhelming public support.",

        "article": "With only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.Here is who has declined so far:Elton John(AFP/Getty Images)This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be \"the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.\"That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: \"Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.\"John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: \"I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.\"I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.\"Andrea Bocelli(Getty)In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.Ice TAn odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.I just got call to perform at the Inauguration…. I didn’t pick up and Blocked the number. — ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) December 16, 2016He wrote on Twitter: \"I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.\"Celine DionAccording to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.John LegendJohn Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: \"Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.\"We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\"Adam LambertAdam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.\"I don't think I would take money on that one,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.\"The Dixie ChicksSpeaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. \"No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,\" he said.\"If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.\"",

(Photo: Nick Ut, AP)Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon — even in fatalities.San Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that \"we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident.\" It said it disagreed with the charges filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and that it was \"exploring all options with respect to those charges.\"Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

        "article": "Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday.Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.“Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.Conservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.“You will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?” Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.Abby Ohlheiser contributed to this report, which has been updated.Read more:Rep.

The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson’s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable woman—a former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband’s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.\n\nThe room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson script—a bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. “I was telling one of my buddies up there, ‘You know, it’s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.’ And he says, ‘Well, don’t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.’” Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. “And then he says, ‘Thompson, you got it all covered.’” Everyone laughs.\n\nToday, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. “We can’t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We’ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can’t prove they’re terrorists within 24 hours, you’ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain’t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.”\n\nSomeone shouts “Go, Fred, go.”\n\nNow it’s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. “People talk about the last election. They say, ‘The war, the war, the war,’” Thompson says with a sigh. “I think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it’s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made a partnership with the alligators instead.”\n\nA minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. “Maybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues.” The applause builds to a standing ovation. “You know, I had another comment or two,” Thompson says, “but I think that’s the perfect place to stop.”\n\nThompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. “You know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete,” Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. “Without raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I’ve already saved $50 million this year.” Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.\n\nSince announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson’s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn’t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.\n\nSo far, the Thompson bubble has floated skyward on several favorable updrafts. He’s the newest man in the race—and one with celebrity name recognition. He’s a Southerner and arguably the most conservative candidate in a field devoid of hard-liners. Despite his eight years in the Senate, people seem to buy the idea, for the time being anyway, that he’s a Washington outsider. And all of his opponents have significant liabilities. But then again, so does Thompson. Among them are his work ethic and authenticity.\n\nThompson is often compared to Ronald Reagan, not just because they are both actors, but also because of each man’s almost preternatural affability. But Reagan was an unalloyed ideologue when America was looking for one, with eight years as the chief executive of what amounts to one of the world’s largest countries. He wasn’t elected until his third campaign, when he defeated a weak Democratic incumbent. Fred Thompson is in a different place. If he’s going to be elected the leader of the Free World, he may have to do it on the strength of his not inconsiderable personal charm.\n\nYou can’t get to Fred Thompson’s hometown from here. Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is located 28 miles from the nearest interstate. Its rolling hills are picturesquely dotted with pigs and cattle, but it remains one of the state’s poorest areas. “This town hasn’t been the same since the Yankees came in and opened the Murray bike factory,” says Tommy Beuerlein, who owns a downtown pharmacy and was a classmate of Thompson’s. The bike factory arrived in 1955. “Nixon was right about there being a silent majority in America,” Beuerlein proudly says. “It’s right here.”\n\nOn a recent summer day, eighteen people attended a city-council meeting dealing with the local problem of illegal dumping of couches. A few steps away, 71 residents, some of them as young as 9, attended a shotgun-safety class. “You have to respect your zone of fire,” insisted the instructor. “Vice-President Cheney didn’t respect his zone of fire, and look what happened.”\n\nMuch of Thompson’s down-home affability can be attributed to his roots in Lawrenceburg, where as a child he pretended to be Western star Lash LaRue and courted his high-school sweetheart underneath the town’s Davy Crockett statue (true story). But while Thompson may be a country boy, he’s a certain type of country boy: the one who plays possum while you mock his cornpone ways. Next thing you know he’s got your girl and holds the deed to your farm.\n\nThompson’s father, Fletch, ran a used-car lot in the center of town, and would talk Republican politics at the Blue Ribbon Café. Neither of Thompson’s parents attended high school (his father eventually earned a GED), and Fred, the first of two sons, proved to be an indifferent but popular student. Even as a kid, Fred had a flair for showmanship. One of the building blocks of the Thompson legend is the story of his concerned football coach’s running onto the field to check on an injured Thompson. When coach Garner Ezell reached his player, Thompson smiled at his fellow Church of Christ parishioner and quipped, “How’s the crowd takin’ it?”\n\n“Fred said it,” says Ezell. “But he wasn’t ever hurt. He was just tired and wanted a rest.”\n\nEven a blind squirrel sometimes finds a nut, and Thompson has always seemed to have a way of stumbling into success. By all accounts, Thompson’s work ethic kicked in at 17, when he got his sweetheart Sarah Lindsey pregnant and immediately proposed. “I barely got out of high school,” Thompson told the Washington Post in 1985. “I was interested in two things—and sports was one of them.”\n\nBecause of his marriage, Thompson didn’t play sports his senior year, and he put in long shifts at the bike factory to support his new family. The following fall, the newlyweds headed to nearby Florence State, now the University of North Alabama, before transferring to Memphis State, from which they both graduated. Sarah’s grandfather was an influential Lawrenceburg lawyer, and her family urged Thompson to apply to Vanderbilt Law School. After graduating, the couple moved back to Lawrenceburg, and Thompson practiced law with Sarah’s uncle and began dabbling in local GOP politics, eventually joining the county’s Republican Executive Committee. It was through that group that Thompson caught the eye of another accidental benefactor, Tennessee senator Howard Baker. Thompson worked on Baker’s 1972 reelection, sometimes driving the senator around Tennessee, and the two men struck up a friendship.\n\nBy the next year, Watergate was everywhere. And while Yale and Harvard up-and-comers like Hillary Clinton and Bill Weld clawed for minor legal positions, Baker offered Thompson a coveted slot as minority counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee.\n\nIn 1975, Thompson wrote \"At That Point in Time: The Inside Story of the Senate Watergate Committee\", about the experience, portraying himself as the picture of the awestruck country lawyer. He insists when Baker offered him the job in February of 1973, “the only names I could recall without prompting were Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy.”\n\nBecause it was a Republican investigator who had uncovered the fact that Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield had admitted that the White House featured an elaborate taping system, Baker insisted that a Republican cross-examine Butterfield the next day so the GOP could maintain the illusion of impartiality—and take credit. On national television, Thompson asked Butterfield the now famous line, “Are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” Butterfield famously answered yes (as everyone already knew he would). It was Thompson’s first star turn, a role that marked him in America’s minds as a righteous heavyweight prosecutor.\n\nThompson’s own book suggests he wasn’t exactly an impartial participant in the proceedings, however. He admits to leaking the news about the Butterfield discovery to Nixon’s lawyers without authorization. Transcripts from the Nixon Tapes also suggest Thompson was at least partially in Nixon’s pocket. As the Watergate Committee prepared to call Nixon aide John Dean, Nixon lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt coached Thompson on how to question Dean. Buzhardt told Nixon, “I found Thompson most cooperative, feeling more Republican every day.” The next day, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig reported to the president, “He [Thompson] thinks we’re in good shape.” Of course, they were not. Not long after, Dean became the first Nixon aide to directly tie the president to the break-in and cover-up. But Thompson’s reputation as a plain-speaking crusader for truth and justice had already been made.\n\nThompson’s acting career also happened by accident. After parlaying his Watergate fame into big speaking fees and the start of a lucrative lobbying career (his clients included Westinghouse and the Tennessee savings-and-loans industry), Thompson returned to private practice in Tennessee. There, he wound up representing Marie Ragghianti, the head of the Tennessee Parole Board who was fired by Democratic governor Ray Blanton for exposing a parole-for-sale scheme. Ragghianti sued for wrongful dismissal, and Thompson won the case. Serpico author Peter Maas wrote a book about Ragghianti’s story that was eventually optioned as a movie with Sissy Spacek slated to play the title role.\n\nAccording to Thompson lore, director Roger Donaldson had to plead with Thompson to audition to play himself. “The idea of him playing himself was reached,” Donaldson told the Nashville Tennessean in May of this year. “And so I said to Fred, ‘Would you be interested at having a go at playing yourself?’ He was like, ‘Shucks, do you think I could do that?’ I said, ‘You never know until you try.’”\n\nHowever, back in 1985, when the movie was made, Thompson freely admitted he’d lobbied Donaldson hard until he scored an audition. Although the film wasn’t especially successful, Thompson received raves, including one that described him as the movie’s “real discovery.”\n\nBored with the law and in the process of getting a divorce from Lindsey, Thompson started work on a novel and began going on auditions. The book was never published, but within a few years, Thompson had become a Hollywood go-to guy for gruff government types, eventually playing a CIA director in No Way Out and a navy admiral in The Hunt for Red October. Most of his parts didn’t take long to film, so Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game. Tennessee insiders tried to persuade Thompson to run for the retiring Baker’s seat in 1984, but he declined, quipping to the Washington Post, “the hassle factor is up and the pay is not.”\n\nThe day after his South Carolina speech in June, Thompson headed to New Hampshire for a bit of packaged politicking to be chronicled by the home team. With rare exceptions, Thompson has limited his media exposure to reliably conservative outlets like The Weekly Standard, Sean Hannity, and Fox News. This morning, Fox had the exclusive.\n\nThe first stop was Riley’s gun shop, the largest rifle-and-pistol joint in New Hampshire. A few minutes after noon, two black SUVs barreled down the two-lane blacktop and were waved into the parking lot by a Thompson aide. The cars emptied, and Thompson emerged with Jeri. Thompson’s blue suit was a torrent of wrinkles—he conjured up ’60 Nixon more than ’80 Reagan. His better half looked, well, better in a smart black suit that seemed a slight bit of overkill for a gun-and-ammo stop. They held hands and walked up a wheelchair-accessible ramp into Riley’s, where two or three customers idly chatted with the help about the stability of this or that rifle scope.\n\nThompson glanced around at the 4,000 guns, and strode toward an employee. “I’ve been looking into your record, and I’m really looking forward to you getting into the race,” said Robert Brown, a 34-year-old salesman. Thompson beamed, pumped his hand, and told him, “We need to get back to basics.”\n\nFred and Jeri then made a loop of the store, pausing before a glass display case that could be used to showcase engagement rings. Here at Riley’s, it housed a dozen glimmering Saturday night specials. Thompson lovingly nudged his spouse and tilted his noggin toward a coal-black .38 Smith & Wesson and cooed, “Honey, would you like one of those?”\n\nOn the way out, I tried again to get Thompson to veer off-script. I jokingly asked him if he had more experience hunting than does Romney, who had been lampooned for saying he hunted varmints. As in a bad movie, time stopped for a second as I realized I’d just set foot on a land mine of my own laying. Jeri beamed, and Fred halted his walk back to the car. He shot a look at the camera crews—Fox had sent two—and waited a second for everyone to settle in again. This is why they made the visit: It was time to contrast the man’s man Thompson with his effete competitors.\n\n“I’ve got a little different eating habits,” joked Thompson. “I’ve hunted pheasants, and I like to skeet shoot. We’d hold a celebrity skeet-shooting contest in Washington, raise money for juvenile diabetes. Now, I’ve held it, I’ve never won it. They couldn’t slow those things down enough for me.”\n\nThe Fox crew nodded appreciatively. A moment later, the SUVs peeled away. The whole stop lasted far shorter than an episode of Law & Order, and was just as well-directed.\n\nThompson changed his mind about the Senate in 1993, when Al Gore was elected vice-president and his seat became open. Thompson’s opponent was Congressman Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat and the son of a former governor. At first, the candidates projected similar images of dark-suited blandness. “I remember an early event at the Peabody hotel in Memphis,” says Mike Kopp, Cooper’s press secretary. “Cooper was a black hole of charisma: He didn’t have any, and he’d suck up yours. But Fred didn’t come across as exactly electric.”\n\nIn May 1994, Thompson trailed badly and talked of quitting. Frustrated, he called Knoxville political consultant Tom Ingram, who had masterminded Lamar Alexander’s 1978 election as Tennessee governor. Alexander wasn’t Mr. Personality either, but he caught fire when Ingram put him in a plaid shirt and had him walk across the state (a tactic, it’s worth noting, that later bombed when Alexander ran for president). Thompson and Ingram met at a Cracker Barrel restaurant halfway between Nashville and Knoxville. “He was talking of getting out, and I asked him how’d he want to do this,” remembers Ingram. “Fred said, ‘Just driving around talking to people.’ I said, ‘Well, let’s get you a truck and do it.’”\n\nAlthough some of his campaign staff protested the move as cheesy, they leased Thompson a red Chevy pickup and he hit the road. Cooper attempted to paint Thompson as phony, calling him a “Gucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey Poupon–spreading millionaire Washington special-interest lobbyist.” But voters loved the truck. They didn’t seem to mind that the candidate often switched from a sedan to the truck just miles from his appearances. “We couldn’t believe anyone was buying it,” says Kopp. “We underestimated him. What we didn’t get is that Fred is the country version of a street kid. He’s been talking his way out of situations since he was in high school. He’s a charmer. People fall for it.”\n\nKopp and Ingram are friends, and Kopp expresses admiration for the consultant’s work. “Fred Thompson was miscast at the beginning of the race,” Kopp says. “So Tom just recast the role, and Fred Thompson played it perfectly.”\n\nIngram disagrees. “The reason the truck worked is that that is Fred Thompson. Gimmicks fail in campaigns all the time because they don’t ring true. Yeah, Fred is a lawyer and an actor, but he is also a country guy. People sense that.”\n\nThompson ended up winning by twenty points, partially aided by the Gingrich sweep of 1994. He drove the red truck to Washington where his old boss Baker threw a raucous party for him. According to The Washington Monthly, a gleeful Thompson mentioned that the craziness made him think of the party his fellow Tennessean Andrew Jackson had at the White House on the night of his inauguration.\n\n“One office at a time,” cautioned Baker.\n\nA few hours after the Riley’s stop in Manchester, Thompson reappeared for a fund-raiser at Bedford’s Wayfarer Inn, a hotel known for decades as a base for reporters boozing their way through the New Hampshire primaries. On this 90-degree summer scorcher, the air-conditioning in the small conference room where Thompson was supposed to greet high rollers was on the fritz. Not even Jeri’s perky smile and repeated recanting of “Hi, I’m Jeri, and I’m your official greeter tonight” could relieve the torpor.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, Thompson emerged, covered in sweat and looking dangerously gray. For a moment, a “What the hell have I got myself into?” look crossed his face. There was another, less exclusive fund-raiser just down the hall, packed with TV cameras (the Fox exclusive had been lifted), but Thompson bargained for some down time. “Give me five minutes,” he asked. He didn’t look like a man in game shape.\n\nTwenty minutes later, a car drove him to the other side of the hotel, either to make his entrance grander or to save him the two-minute walk. After a brief introduction, Thompson took the microphone and talked about terrorism. He spoke in a reassuring, fatherly voice. “We’re confronted with a group of people who killed thousands of our people and would like nothing more than to get their hands on technology to kill millions,” Thompson said. “They’re getting ready to resume a war that’s been going on for hundreds of years, and they have another hundred-year plan. Some of our leaders got a plan for the next election,” he continued, presumably referring to those leaders who want to pull out of Iraq. “And they think they can win votes out of it.” As a policy idea, it wasn’t what one would call a breakthrough, nor was it much of an applause line. When Thompson talks about issues, his speeches tend to lose focus and drift.\n\nBut when the speech ended and the music blared, Thompson got in the Country Fred groove. He was doing the walk and talk, where he is most successful. “Keep your powder dry,” Thompson told his fans. He paused mid-mob to answer a Franklin Pierce College poli-sci student’s question about entitlements. This time it was a TV reporter who ventured an unsanctioned question, asking Thompson whether he was a lazy man. Thompson didn’t get angry; he just laughed. “That’s what they said about me before I ran the first time, and that’s what they said about me two years later,” he replied. “I won the first time by twenty points, and 21 points the second time. If you can do that while being lazy, I recommend it to everyone.”\n\nthe greatest testament to the power of Fred Thompson’s down-home likability might be that his Senate years were widely viewed as a train wreck, yet he emerged not only unscathed but also as a presidential contender.\n\nThings started auspiciously enough. Because Thompson had been elected to fill Gore’s unexpired term, he was sworn in a month before other freshmen senators on December 9, 1994. Republicans didn’t waste any time putting the actor in front of the cameras. On December 15, Thompson gave the Republicans’ response to President Clinton’s budget address. Thompson spoke for only five minutes, but he struck a chord. A STAR IS BORN read the headline of Frank Rich’s New York Times column.\n\nBut that would be the high point. Thompson spent the next two years accomplishing almost nothing of significance other than raising money for his 1996 reelection: Thompson brought back the red truck and won in a walk.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton easily trounced Bob Dole in that year’s presidential race, allegations surfaced that the Chinese government had funneled money into the Clinton campaign and that Al Gore had attended a fund-raiser at a Los Angeles Buddhist temple financed by foreign nationals. Thompson, chairman of the previously backwaterish Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which had jurisdiction, called for hearings.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the hearings that July, the papers were filled with stories of Thompson’s Watergate role and his prosecutorial flair. The Democrats’ ranking minority member was John Glenn, and the conventional wisdom was that Thompson would charm the octogenarian into submission. It didn’t happen. Thompson condescended to Glenn and alienated members of his own party. When New Hampshire Republican Bob Smith announced in his opening statement, “It is probably the biggest scandal in the history of the Republic,” Thompson turned to the Democratic side, rolled his eyes, and muttered, “Jesus Christ.”\n\nIn 2005, Thompson donated his Senate papers to the University of Tennessee. Some of his archives are filled with notes of off-the-record interviews Thompson conducted with reporters during his Senate years. In his papers, Thompson complains about the trouble he had managing his colleagues during the 1996 hearings. He speaks of “members on your [own] side, grilling your team to a point where [you have to] get them to a room, woodshed them, [on] how to ask questions, how to proceed.”\n\nThompson was also accused of grandstanding, and his relationship with then Republican Senate leaders Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell quickly soured. Soon Thompson was warring with both sides. “[We have] presidents at fund-raisers, Lott [saying] raising money is the American Way, [and] McConnell [is the] Darth Vader of Reform,” Thompson says in one of the off-the-record sessions found in his archives.\n\nThompson’s hearings grew even more unpopular with his own party when he diverted the proceedings to the subject of campaign-finance reform (Senate Republicans opposed such reform for fear of losing hard-won fund-raising advantages). Lott was furious, and Thompson suspected the majority leader was the anonymous author of quotes criticizing the hearings.\n\nThe senator further angered conservatives by becoming an early supporter of the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance-reform legislation. Although Thompson has recently tried to minimize his enthusiasm for the bill, his Senate papers include a handwritten note from Senator Russell Feingold after the measure passed the Senate in 2001 reading, “You were essential to our success from the outset!”\n\nThompson’s Senate years also featured a level of sympathy for Bill Clinton that conservatives don’t tend to share. In 1995, Thompson’s archives show, he sent Clinton a note after the State of the Union address that partially read, “The speech probably would not have seemed so long to some of us if you hadn’t been putting the wood to us so effectively.” Thompson’s 1999 split vote on Clinton’s two counts of impeachment squared with one of his off-the-record sessions in 1998, when he told reporters, “I’m prejudiced in his favor, I object to the tactics used against him.” This didn’t stop Thompson from sending Kenneth Starr a congratulations letter at the end of the Clinton saga.\n\nThompson may blast colleagues for not draining the Washington swamp, but he did his share of feeding the alligators. His papers include ingratiating notes to George Will, Arianna Huffington, and Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. There’s a mash note from Bruce Willis (“You were great in Die Hard”) and a letter from Oliver Stone thanking Thompson for brokering an interview with Martin Luther King Jr. assassin James Earl Ray.\n\nThompson’s off-the-record chats with reporters also suggest that his claim that he hasn’t given much thought to running for president might be somewhat disingenuous (his campaign has attempted to make a virtue of the fact that Thompson, unlike his competitors, isn’t obsessed with power). During one 1998 off-the-record bull session, Thompson boasted to a reporter, “Al Gore goes to bed at night and says, ‘Please don’t let it be Fred Dalton Thompson.’”\n\nAs a senator and movie star of a certain age, Thompson was a steadily sought-after D.C. bachelor. He alternately dated Lorrie Morgan, a five-times-married country-music star, Republican pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, former Time columnist Margaret Carlson, and Washington socialite Georgette Mosbacher. “I chased a lot of women, and a lot of women chased me,” Thompson told Republican congressmen earlier this year. “And those that chased me tended to catch me.”\n\nThompson’s relationships with the Washington elite, romantic and otherwise, have paid significant dividends. This March, Carlson talked up Thompson’s presidential possibilities on MSNBC, rhapsodizing, “He’s handsome, he’s charming, he sounds like a president, and he looks like a president.” She didn’t disclose their prior personal relationship.\n\nThompson scored more gravitas points last month when Washington Post columnist and socialite Sally Quinn breathlessly wrote that Vice-President Dick Cheney was on his way out and should be replaced by, yes, Fred Thompson. “Everybody loves Fred,” Quinn wrote. “He has the healing qualities of Gerald Ford and the movie-star appeal of Ronald Reagan.” For what it’s worth, they both appeared in the 1994 remake of Born Yesterday.\n\nTalking about his Senate years in July, Thompson said, “When I served eight years, I left. I was following George Washington’s model of serving eight years, getting on his horse, and never coming back.”\n\nIt’s only partially true. After 9/11, Thompson announced he would seek reelection the next year. But in January 2002, Thompson’s daughter Betsy died of an accidental drug overdose, ending a long, troubled life. In March, Thompson withdrew his candidacy and sharply criticized the media coverage of Betsy’s death. “I simply do not have the heart for another six years,” he said at the time.\n\nA few months before he left office, Thompson received a call. This time, his career angel was Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, who offered him the role of Arthur Branch over the phone. He immediately accepted. Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game in 2004 by taking on Equitas Ltd., a British reinsurer responsible for paying out millions in asbestos claims. Equitas wanted Senate legislation that would limit its liability and paid Thompson $760,000 over the next three years. He also serves as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and in 2005 helped shepherd Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts through his Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nIn 2002, Thompson married Jeri. The couple met in 1995 (Jeri was a Republican spokesperson at the time) on the Nashville yacht of Dale Gish, on the Fourth of July. Their relationship was on and off for years, with Kehn memorably complaining about other rivals to the New York Post in 2000. “They just won’t leave him alone,” she said. “I can’t get up to get a cocktail at a party without coming back and finding some girl sitting in my chair.” Fred and Jeri have since had two children, Hayden and an 8-month-old son named Samuel.\n\nLast November, Thompson said he wouldn’t run for president, telling a political dinner-party gathering, “I would have had to start two years ago if I was going to run. I don’t think I’d ever want to jump back in.”\n\nBut with Giuliani, McCain, and Romney appearing vulnerable, Howard Baker began making calls around Washington to gauge the interest for a late-entering telegenic southern senator.\n\nOr so the story goes. Some Republican insiders say it is Jeri who is fanning Thompson’s presidential aspirations. While Ingram won’t confirm that, he does say Jeri played an influential role in the handling of her husband’s April announcement that he had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but is now in remission. The move was seen as a way of clearing the decks for a Thompson presidential run. “He relies on her,” Ingram says. “They’re definitely partners.”\n\nTo some, Jeri has already become a target. MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough mused, “You think she works the pole?” and the New York Times “Styles” section raised the question of whether America was ready for a trophy-wife First Lady.\n\nAfter getting the high sign from Thompson, Ingram began talking up a Thompson candidacy on Capitol Hill, where Ingram now works as Lamar Alexander’s chief of staff. “I was at the Capitol Hill Club at Bill Hecht’s table,” recalls Ingram, name-dropping the presence of a prominent Republican lobbyist. “Congressmen and lobbyists were coming up to me, and they were all really excited. It’s the closest thing to a presidential draft in my lifetime,” Ingram insists. I asked him whether the well-heeled well-wishers were familiar with Thompson from his Senate days. He hemmed and hawed a bit. “Well no, they mostly know him more from Law & Order than the Senate, but Fred’s not acting on the show. That’s exactly the way Fred was in his Senate office.”\n\nNow comes the hard part. With Thompson all but officially in the race, the media has begun training its sights on his backside.

        "article": "rts from sources close to the Pentagon have disclosed that the 2 million rounds of ammunition, which according to previous reports went missing under Obama's administration, were actually seized by US forces in Afghanistan. The insider sources, who preferred to remain anonymous, reported that the rounds were found in an enemy weapons cache in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan and it was evident that they had been intended for use against US troops stationed in the area.\n\nAccording to the insider sources, the rounds were of multiple calibers and appeared to have been manufactured in the US. Military analysts have pointed out the potential threat to US soldiers if the ammunition had been used against them. One analyst pointed out that ammunition is one of the key supplies that the enemy needs to carry out attacks against US forces, and that the discovery of large amounts of ammunition in enemy hands is a major cause for concern.\n\nThe revelation of the discovery of the missing ammunition has sparked off a debate in the political circles, with some hawks pointing fingers at the Obama administration for the loss of the ammunition, and others praising the troops who recovered the rounds. A spokesperson for the Pentagon has called for calm and urged the public not to jump to conclusions before a full investigation can be completed.\n\nThe missing ammunition has been the subject of intense controversy, with conspiracy theories floating around about the possible involvement of the previous administration. Now that it has been revealed that the ammunition has been recovered, the new administration is expected to be relieved, while questions will still be raised over how the rounds ended up in enemy hands in the first place.",

        "article": "By Sen. Rand Paul\n\nRumors have been circulating that President-elect Donald Trump is considering John Bolton for the position of Secretary of State. As an opponent of the Iraq war and regime change, I am concerned about this potential appointment and whether it aligns with Trump's previous stance on these issues.\n\nOne of the reasons I admired Trump during his campaign was his understanding of the mistakes made during the Iraq war and how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East, ultimately empowering Iran. However, John Bolton, a longtime member of the Washington elite, has failed to learn from these mistakes, and it is unlikely that he will do so in the future.\n\nBolton stood in opposition to Trump's advice on numerous occasions, and his foreign policy views are reminiscent of the failed policies of the past 15 years. He was a vocal supporter of overthrowing Saddam Hussein, even going so far as to say that the decision was correct 13 years after the fact. In contrast, Trump recognizes that the Iraq war destabilized the region and facilitated the rise of ISIS.\n\nFurthermore, Bolton has expressed his desire to pursue regime change in countries like Syria and Iran, similar to the failed approach in Iraq. It is clear that he has not learned from past mistakes and is out of touch with the reality in the Middle East. His lack of nuance and his insistence on all-out war make him a dangerous candidate for the position of Secretary of State.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bolton, like many of his generation, avoided serving in the military when the Vietnam draft was in effect, citing a lack of desire to die in Southeast Asia. Yet, he appears to have no qualms about sending other people's sons and daughters into harm's way.\n\nIn a time when Americans are looking for change and new thinking, Bolton represents failed foreign policy and is a menace to our national security. It is important to remember that our Constitution explicitly states that war should not be fought without the permission of Congress. As a senator, I will fulfill my constitutional duty by opposing any advocate for war, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nPresident-elect Trump campaigned on the promise to change our foreign policy, and appointing John Bolton would be a significant step back from that promise. I urge the incoming administration to reconsider this appointment and instead choose a Secretary of State who truly aligns with the desire for change and a more thoughtful approach to foreign policy.\n\nRand Paul is the junior senator from Kentucky.",

A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found “toxic pills” inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius’ alleged plot against the prison staff.

        "article": "During a private fundraiser earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made controversial remarks about voters who support President Barack Obama. In the secret video obtained by Mother Jones, Romney can be heard dismissing Obama supporters as freeloaders who pay no taxes and believe that the government should take care of them. He suggests that these individuals lack personal responsibility and are dependent on the government.\n\nRomney stated that there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for Obama no matter what, referring to them as people who are dependent upon the government and consider themselves victims. He argued that they believe they are entitled to healthcare, food, housing, and other benefits provided by the government. Romney added that these individuals do not pay income taxes.\n\nThe video also revealed Romney's views on other topics. He commented on his family background, expressing that if his father had been born to Mexican parents, he would have a better chance at winning the election. Romney emphasized his self-made millionaire status and stated that being born in America with privileges was the greatest gift one could have.\n\nRomney acknowledged that he was facing challenges in winning over Hispanic voters but believed that women were open to supporting him. He advised the donors at the fundraiser to raise millions of dollars to support his campaign.\n\nThe Republican candidate revealed that his campaign was hesitant to attack Obama aggressively, as they did not want to alienate independent voters who had previously supported the president. Romney indicated that his campaign aimed to convince these voters that Obama's policies had failed, without vilifying the president.\n\nRomney boasted about the experienced consultants on his team, mentioning that some had worked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He expressed confidence that winning the election would lead to economic growth and positive market reactions.\n\nDuring the fundraiser, Romney stated that the campaign purposefully limited the appearances of his wife, Ann Romney, so that people would not get tired of her. He also turned down an invitation from Saturday Night Live, as he believed it would make him appear slapstick and not presidential.\n\nThese remarks by Romney, made in the presence of wealthy donors, were considered controversial and showed a different side of him compared to his public campaign messaging. The video caused significant backlash and raised questions about Romney's views and ability to relate to a broad spectrum of voters.",

Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him.Politico’s White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as “us” in his speech. “Just noticed the use of ‘us’ in this transcript,” wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet.“Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us?” she wrongly quoted the president as sayingSpeaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the “alt-left” (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts.In the speech, Trump clearly says “Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at ‘em?”.@realDonaldTrump gave the media DAYS to call out the antifa, BLM, etc Instead the #FakeNews covered for them…today it blew up on them. pic.twitter.com/QqDgwenIZD — Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) August 15, 2017As Karni’s tweet made the rounds on Twitter, some—including CNN’s Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. “Transcript may be funky,” he wrote.Others, like New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers.Haberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood.Despite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some. One user, Brian Klaas, jumped to erroneous conclusions and wondered if Trump had made a Freudian slip. “Trump lumps himself with his white supremacist supporters,” wrote Klaas in a now-deleted tweet.The fake news stems from Politico’s inaccurate transcription of Donald Trump’s speech. A snapshot of the transcript on Archive.is reveals the presence of the fake quote.The updated version of the transcript fixed the error, but did not acknowledge that any edits were made. Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction at the bottom.“In a review of the audio, we could not definitively discern Trump’s exact words at that moment in the news conference,” the site claims. Rather puzzlingly, Politico had no problem peppering “REPORTERS YELL INDISTINCTLY” throughout the piece.",

        "article": "Speaking in Cleveland, Ohio, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for unity in the wake of the tragic shooting in Orlando. Here are key moments from that speech. (Video: Reuters/Associated Press)\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, addressed a crowd in Cleveland and pledged to take on \"lone wolves\" who might carry out terrorist attacks in the United States. She called for unity in the face of the recent massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.\n\nClinton began her speech by expressing her gratitude to everyone in attendance and commending the work done at the Industrial Innovation Center. She specifically praised Team Wendy for their efforts to protect troops and first responders from traumatic brain injuries. The audience expressed their support for Clinton throughout her speech, chanting \"We want Hillary!\"\n\nAcknowledging the tragic events in Orlando, Clinton emphasized that it was not a day for politics. She highlighted the nightmare that Americans woke up to and condemned the act of terrorism that took place in a place no one expected. Clinton stressed that the shooter was filled with hate and targeted LGBT Americans, representing an attack on the openness and diversity that defines the American way of life.\n\nWhile the investigation into the shooter and his motives is ongoing, Clinton called for a united front against terrorism. She stated that the threat posed by radical jihadists is profound and must be defeated. Clinton reaffirmed her plan to defeat ISIS and other radical jihadist groups, emphasizing that the coalition effort in Syria and Iraq has made recent gains. She proposed ramping up the air campaign, providing support to friends fighting on the ground, and urging regional partners to do more.\n\nClinton also called for the hardening of defenses at home, providing better support to first responders, law enforcement, and intelligence officers. She stressed the need for improved intelligence and resources to prevent attacks before they happen. Clinton reiterated her stance on assault weapons, stating that if someone is on the FBI's watchlist, they should not be able to easily obtain a firearm.\n\nIn addition to taking action against jihadists, Clinton emphasized the importance of countering radicalization and preventing the recruitment efforts of ISIS and other terrorist networks. She called for better cooperation with Muslim American communities and worked towards building relationships based on trust. Clinton also highlighted the need to combat online propaganda by intercepting communication, tracking social media posts, and promoting credible voices.\n\nClinton ended her speech by emphasizing the strength of the American people when united and called for a sense of common purpose, just as Americans displayed after the 9/11 attacks. She expressed her confidence that Americans will overcome the threats of terrorism and other challenges when they come together.",

He stressed the need to explore areas of constructive dialogue and engage directly with Iranian officials. Obama expressed optimism that diplomatic overtures would allow the United States to move its policy in a new direction.\n\nHowever, the former President acknowledged the challenging task ahead, as years of mistrust have built up between the two nations.

He called for Iran to send signals indicating its willingness to act differently and recognize the responsibilities that come with its rights as a member of the international community.\n\nSwitching topics, Obama addressed concerns about the lack of bipartisanship in the stimulus package. While acknowledging the absence of votes from opposing party members, he stressed that the focus should be on the number of jobs that will be created. Obama highlighted the importance of prioritizing economic recovery and emphasized bipartisan efforts for the overall progress of the nation.\n\nIn conclusion, Obama's prime-time press briefing outlined his administration's intentions to engage in diplomatic dialogue with Iran.

        "article": "COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County.

This legal action comes as Trump also faces mounting scrutiny and legal challenges over various allegations, including potential indictments.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by a coalition of immigrant rights groups, argues that Trump's decision to terminate DACA was motivated by racial bias and animosity. DACA, established in 2012, protects young undocumented immigrants, commonly referred to as Dreamers, who were brought to the United States as children. The termination of DACA, an executive order issued by President Barack Obama, has been a contentious issue ever since.\n\nLegal experts supporting the plaintiffs claim that Trump's decision to revoke DACA was not based on legitimate policy concerns but rather on discriminatory prejudices against immigrants. They argue that this action violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nIn recent months, multiple court rulings have blocked efforts by the Trump administration to end DACA fully. However, the latest lawsuit seeks to hold Trump personally accountable for his alleged discriminatory actions. The plaintiffs hope that this legal action will result in a court ruling that prevents any future attempts to dismantle the program.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump faces a separate legal battle as reports suggest he could potentially be indicted on various charges. In a recent segment on her show, political commentator Rachel Maddow discussed the possibility of Trump being indicted, asserting that he knew his actions were wrongful when committing them.\n\nThe potential indictment revolves around a number of matters, including potential finance and tax-related violations. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how these allegations will be addressed within the legal system.",

        "article": "Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been actively promoting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to the alarming number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. The bill recently passed in the Senate by a margin of 94-1, with Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse being the sole dissenter who believes that tackling addiction should be a local issue.\n\nOhio is among the states greatly affected by the national heroin epidemic. In Montgomery County, which includes Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased by a staggering 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nHistorically, the predominant type of heroin on U.S. streets during the 1970s was the \"black tar\" variety, originating mainly from southeast Asia. However, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in 2010, 80 percent of the world's heroin came from poppy fields in Afghanistan.\n\nConsidering Portman's statement that most of the heroin in the United States comes from Mexico's border, there were initial doubts about the accuracy of this claim. Nevertheless, it seems that Portman has been diligent in studying the issue. The Drug Enforcement Administration's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 confirms Mexico as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\nAccording to the report, \"Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" and Mexico, along with Colombia to a lesser extent, dominates the U.S. heroin market due to its proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to meet the demand.\n\nThe report further highlights that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations\" pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States, with no other group presently in a position to challenge them.\n\nAdditionally, the National Drug Threat report notes that while Colombian gangs traditionally supplied wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups, Mexican cartels are increasingly taking on a larger role in the supply chain. Opium production in Mexico saw a 50 percent increase in 2014.\n\nMoreover, Mexican labs are also responsible for producing fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl is occasionally mixed with heroin or used as a substitute, resulting in over 700 reported overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015, as per the DEA.\n\nDuring a March 8 hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson confirmed that drugs mostly enter the U.S. by land rather than by sea. The Washington Post's 2015 series on the surge of heroin also reveals that the border detection rate stands at a mere 1.5 percent.\n\nThe resourcefulness of drug smugglers often defies gravity, as seen in a successful bust where agents intercepted two men attempting to fly a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nIn conclusion, Portman's claim that most heroin in the U.S. is coming from Mexico has been supported by the Drug Enforcement Administration's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015. Evidence indicates that Mexican transnational criminal organizations pose the greatest drug threat to the country, given their proximity and established infrastructure. Additionally, Mexico is witnessing an increase in opium production, while also being a source of the dangerous synthetic painkiller fentanyl.\n\nTherefore, we rate Portman's claim as True.",

Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook — an American corporation — being banned in the country.Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. \"Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,\" said Trump.Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's \"commitment\" should have not just been limited to Facebook. \"You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,\" Rowlinson said. \"You wouldn't get this from any other guy,\" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.Donald Trump's remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

        "article": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates is considering deploying an additional 3,000 Marines to Afghanistan in order to counter any potential spring offensive by Taliban militants, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell, this proposal is currently under consideration by Secretary Gates. \"He will review it thoroughly before providing his approval,\" Morrell stated.\n\nOver the past two years, violence in Afghanistan has escalated, with the Taliban engaging in a guerilla war in the south and east, alongside high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country.\n\nIn an effort to address the escalating violence, Gates has been urging NATO allies to contribute more troops to Afghanistan. However, if the Secretary of Defense endorses this proposal, it will indicate that Washington has acknowledged the need to provide a significant proportion of additional combat forces.\n\nTo respond to the increased violence, Gates had previously ordered a surge in U.S. forces in early 2007, resulting in a record-high of 27,000 troops currently stationed in Afghanistan. Approximately half of these troops are part of the 40,000-strong NATO security assistance force, while the rest are involved in various missions, including counter-terrorism and training Afghan troops.\n\nWhile NATO claims to have thwarted last year's attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence has risen by 27 percent compared to the previous year. The southern province of Helmand has experienced a staggering 60 percent increase in violence, as reported by the U.S. military last month.\n\nGeoff Morrell stated that the majority of the additional Marines would be deployed to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian, and Dutch troops have been heavily engaged in combat. \"The aim is to have them in place by April to prevent a repeat of last spring's attempted comeback by the Taliban,\" Morrell explained. \"This deployment is a one-time, seven-month mission.\"\n\nFollowing his meeting with allies in Scotland last month, Secretary Gates hinted at a shift away from pressing NATO nations to contribute combat troops, given the political challenges they face. He suggested that allies should focus on supporting other aspects of the mission, such as rebuilding Afghanistan. This change in approach places a greater burden on the United States in terms of combat responsibilities.\n\n\"The commander on the ground requires additional forces, and since our allies are unable to provide them, we are now considering shouldering some of that additional load,\" Morrell added.\n\nThe Taliban government was ousted by U.S.-led forces in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States.\n\nMorrell mentioned that the plan to deploy the Marines would be included in a schedule of deployment proposals to be presented to Secretary Gates on Friday.\n\nThe plan involves sending a Marine Air Ground Task Force to combat the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, along with deploying a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces.\n\nAccording to a U.S. military official, the Joint Staff of the Pentagon developed this plan in response to a request from Admiral William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East. The proposal also enjoys the support of Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",

        "title": "Rick Santorum: By Amending Constitution, We Can Achieve Permanent Budget Balance",
        "article": "By RICK SANTORUM\n\nLast summer, the country witnessed a significant surge of support for addressing our fiscal challenges through cutting federal spending, implementing spending caps, and passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. However, instead of taking the lead, the President chose to delegate these tough decisions to a bureaucratic committee in Washington. Unfortunately, the self-proclaimed 'Supercommittee' failed to reach an agreement on even minor spending cuts. As a result, we now face severe defense cuts at a time when the threat of a nuclear Iran looms large.\n\nI fully supported the 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' movement, but the reality is that we need a comprehensive approach focused on balancing our budget and fostering economic growth. Without a balanced budget amendment, we can never truly rely on the government's commitment to fiscal responsibility.\n\nBoth political parties may discuss fiscal responsibility endlessly, but the only effective way to ensure that our government operates within its means and limit its growth is by passing a balanced budget amendment. This amendment should require a supermajority for tax increases and impose a cap on federal spending at 18 percent of GDP.\n\nCurrently, government spending has spiraled out of control, approaching 25 percent of GDP with projections of reaching 40 percent in the future. This trajectory is unacceptable and needs to be halted.\n\nWhile cutting spending now is necessary, our ultimate goal must be to permanently reduce the size and scope of the federal government. A balanced budget amendment becomes a cornerstone of this economic policy, empowering American families and building economic freedom.\n\nIt is important to note that a balanced budget amendment is not a sudden or drastic measure; rather, it is a long-term, permanent solution to address overspending. The process of passing and ratifying a constitutional amendment typically takes six to eight years. This timeframe allows the government to gradually steer the budget towards fiscal responsibility while setting a deadline for our representatives to fulfill their responsibilities.\n\nThe most appealing aspect of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work. The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, and we came within one vote of passing it. Regrettably, the deciding 'no' vote came from a Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I was not afraid to call for his resignation because I am dedicated to leading, fighting for fiscal responsibility, and exposing members of my own party when they veer from conservative principles.\n\nPassing a balanced budget amendment would also compel the government to tackle the pressing issue of entitlements. For years, Congress has avoided making adjustments to these programs due to political sensitivities. However, the passage of the balanced budget amendment would force us to confront this critical aspect of our fiscal puzzle. Drawing from my experience leading welfare reform efforts in 1996, I am confident that we can make the necessary tough choices to restructure and save these programs.\n\nAdditionally, we must implement policies to stimulate immediate economic growth, starting with revitalizing our manufacturing sector. A thriving manufacturing industry can have a multiplier effect on our economy. To achieve this, we must create an environment conducive to opportunity within our borders. This involves eliminating corporate taxes for manufacturers, rolling back burdensome Obama-era regulations that cost businesses over $100 million annually, and doing away with the excise tax on overseas profits reinvested in American plants and equipment. Furthermore, we must streamline energy production by removing government barriers and encouraging exploration across all energy sources, including oil, natural gas, and coal. Reducing energy costs for consumers and businesses alike will jump-start our economy, broaden our tax base, and help rebuild the middle class, which has suffered as manufacturing jobs disappeared over the past four decades.\n\nYou can trust my unwavering commitment to reigniting our economy, and together, we can achieve what came tantalizingly close: passing a balanced budget amendment. This is the only way to exert permanent control over our budget and secure our financial future.\n\nColumn Presidential Guest Commentary.",

Then the rest of the crew just walked off the plane and left the Saints stranded.\"\n\nThe incident marks a new low in the ongoing controversy surrounding player protests during the national anthem. With ratings for Saints games hitting all-time lows, it remains to be seen whether the team will be able to bounce back from this latest setback.\n\nBut for many, the actions of the flight crew are a symbol of hope in a time of division and turmoil.\n\n\"This is America at its finest,\" said one protester outside the airport. \"We will not be silenced by those who seek to divide us. We will stand together, kneel together, and fight for what we believe in.\"",

        "title": "China's Space Threat: How Missiles Could Target U.S. Satellites",
        "article": "At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small—just 6 ft. long—a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.\n\nIt was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and—boom—obliterated it. \"It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,\" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.\n\nFor China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. \"The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,\" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. \"China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there.\" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of anti-satellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.\n\nINTERNATIONAL THREAT\n\nFor many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. \"Space debris is a huge problem,\" says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"A 1-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed.\" Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as 35,000 of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the 1-cm range. Nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger.\n\nAlthough the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officials—reluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillance—chose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these 33-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth.\n\nBattlefield: Space Media Platforms Design Team\n\n1] Songlin test facility, near Xichang, Sichuan province, China. Publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by China prior to the test; immediately following, they were declassified.\n\n2] Experts believe a four-stage, solidÂ­-fuel launch vehicle—thought by American officials to be based on China's KT-2—boosted the kill vehicle into orbit.\n\n3] The Feng-Yun 1C target vehicle was launched May 10, 1999, with a two-year active life span. The 1650-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation.\n\n4] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18,000 mph when it struck the satellite.\n\n5] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within 7 hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe.\n\nSome details of China's ASAT test are classified. Our artist relied on published reports, declassified information, and comparable technology to create this graphic. The Chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. (Diagram by Golden Section Graphics. Inset satellite photograph by Digital Globe.)\n\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n\nAMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS\n\nEvery industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television, and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones.\n\nSome satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft—including spy sats—are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile—yet it can be done. \"You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,\" says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. \"You'd need ICBM-size boosters—hundreds of them.\"\n\nSuch an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. \"There'd be so much debris up there,\" Clark says, \"that it wouldn't be safe to put anything up in space.\"\n\nThe United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War, spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. \"The consensus,\" Clark says, \"was that anybody could look at anybody else.\"\n\nDiagram: China's anti-satellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in 1962, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles. The explosion, which occurred about 800 miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites—roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately.\n\nTo develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May 23, 1963, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles.\n\nOver the next several decades, the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In 1985, the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-15 fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was canceled before the air-launched system could be perfected.\n\nThat same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In 1997, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year.\n\nSome $400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle—a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high.\n\nDestroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at GlobalSecurity says, \"It's an act of war.\"\n\nU.S. Sat Kill Arsenal\n\n- Perhaps the most spectacular test—known as Starfish Prime—occurred on July 9, 1962, when a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for 20 minutes.\n\n- The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985 when an F-15 climbed to 80,000 ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a 17,500-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n\n- In 1997, the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy and eventually canceled the program.\n\n- The XSS-11 microsatellite isn't an antisat—but it could be. First launched in April 2005, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it wouldn't be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets.\n\nSENDING A MESSAGE\n\nSo why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. \"The experiment is not targeted at any other country,\" said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing.\n\nSome experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that \"The United States considers space capabilities... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests.\"\n\nThe United States \"basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies,\" Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: \"Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state.\"\n\nIn that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. \"The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties,\" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. \"For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength.\"\n\nPike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island.\n\n\"The Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real,\" Pike says. \"Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there won't be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time.\" A half-dozen sats, Pike says—that's all it would take. \"Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nIn that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its war plan is feasible.\n\nAMERICA'S TRUMP CARD\n\nThe long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. \"It was a mistake,\" O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, \"It doesn't help China's case saying it isn't a threatening military power,\" Vick says. \"It is a threat, and the test showed that.\" Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat, and China has only 60 satellites—few of these are worth shooting down.\n\nAmerica's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all—they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, \"just nothing to shoot at.\"\n\nFor now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier.\n\nWaste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude.\n\nJULY 2007 The debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles.\n\nJANUARY 2008 A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from 10-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites.\n\nIt's called the Kessler Syndrome—the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. \"Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay,\" says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. \"We can't track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know.\" The graphic at left illustrates the density of junk in orbit up to an altitude of 22,000 miles—and Kessler's looming threat.",

        "article": "Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.",

In fact, I have repeatedly voted to fund the government in the last few days.\n\nThe shutdown isn't good for anyone in our community or our country. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa has furloughed more than 1,500 employees, putting our national security at risk before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent them back to work this week. Veterans in my district are facing a possible future suspension in claims processing. Tax refunds can't go out. Citrus growers can't access the E-Verify system to ensure work authorization is approved, which limits their hiring ability.\n\nUnfortunately, President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have been unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate, which led to this government shutdown. We can end this if they would join us at the table and compromise, but Senate leaders and our president won't budge.\n\nI want to be clear: I have never supported Obamacare and have voted more than 40 times to defund it, delay it, or repeal it. I went a step further and introduced an amendment to the continuing resolution that would ensure that the full extent of Obamacare applies to members of Congress, the president, the vice president and staff. The House passed my amendment with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Senate hasn't passed any of these bills and refused to even vote on my amendment. We are badly mistaken to think there is any hope of the president eliminating his signature legislation, as awful as it is.\n\nShutting down the government has had zero impact on Obamacare. Unfortunately, some were led to believe that Obamacare would immediately cease if the government shut down. The reality is, however, that despite the government being shut down for multiple days, Obamacare continues to be implemented with all of its glitches and problems. That is because about 70 percent of Obamacare is funded through mandatory funding while the current funding battle only addresses discretionary funding — it doesn't even touch mandatory funding.\n\nSince its grand opening on Oct. 1, Obamacare has been an abject failure. Countless technical glitches have prevented enrollees from accessing the online exchanges, and there are endless reports of consumer sticker shock from the high cost of Obamacare insurance premiums. Americans deserve to know that Obamacare is a disaster. Yet these failures and many more have been overshadowed by the government shutdown and the debate over a continuing resolution that, by law, could never fully defund Obamacare.\n\nObamacare will fall under its own weight of complexities, costs, and inconsistencies, all at the expense of the American people. The best way to repeal Obamacare is to let it take effect, point out its impact, win control of the Senate, and elect a president who will support its repeal.\n\nIn the few years since I was elected to Congress in 2010, we have achieved huge savings and taken monumental steps. For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row. We need to continue to take steps forward, shedding off our \"excessive funding weight\" one pound at a time. That is why I would support a continuing resolution that funds the government at sequestration levels for one year.\n\nWe need to get the government running again and end this shutdown so that our communities can get back on their feet.\n\nRep.

Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2017 at 3am, and will end on Monday, November 30, 2017 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the ‘November Black Out’ event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter.Please enable Javascript to watch this videoThe internet hoax isn't news, with many liars claiming darkness will descend in some New World Order extra-terrestrial scam.NASA has denied it will happen time and time again, stating in over one million years, an event like this has never occurred.The overactive imaginations of conspiracy theorists must be commended, but perhaps next time, put it into a work of science fiction rather than try and pass it off as a NASA-confirmed fact.Craig Hamilton-Parker / YoutubeMeanwhile, on the Internet, other theorists are gearing up for their psychic predictions for 2018, like Craig Hamilton-Parker, the self-proclaimed modern day Nostradamus.A self-proclaimed prophet, who wants to seemingly shatter your dreams, hopes and aspirations for next year with his special potion of unproven alarm and fear-mongering mysticism.Hamilton-Parker, who shares all his best work on YouTube and psychics.com from his home in Southampton, foresees a US attack on North Korea, a chemical attack on a European city and an attempt to impeach Trump.GettyHe doesn't reveal his sources, but it seems he’s really keeping up with current affairs in his mission to pull predictions out of his backside.For 2018 he's bookmarked in his calendar the following world crises: US forces striking North Korea by blowing up a key trade route, Kim Jong-un being overthrown by his own people, a failed attempt to impeach Donald Trump and the sinking of a US warship.GettyThe good news is there’s absolutely no proof this guy has any more insight into what’s going to happen to the global political and social climate in 2018, than he does into what I’m going to have for my dinner.Considering my fridge is empty, my stomach’s growling and I make erratic supermarket decisions when I’m hungry, I’d like to see him try.",

        "article": "U.S. Senator Ben Sasse expressed deep concern over the recent decision by the administration to impose significant steel and aluminum tariffs on longstanding allies, including Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. In a statement, Senator Sasse emphasized the need to distinguish between treating allies and opponents in trade actions.\n\n\"This decision is ill-advised. Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and it is crucial that we do not treat our allies in the same manner as our adversaries,\" Senator Sasse stated. Drawing parallels from history, he pointed out that previous instances of blanket protectionism contributed to America's Great Depression. \n\nThe Senator added, \"'Make America Great Again' should not be synonymous with 'Make America 1929 Again.' It is vital that we approach trade issues prudently and avoid repeating past mistakes.\"\n\nSenator Sasse's remarks highlight the growing concern among lawmakers regarding the potential damaging impact of these tariffs on U.S. relationships with key trading partners. The decision has prompted fears of retaliatory actions and the potential for escalating trade tensions.\n\nAs the administration continues to push its trade agenda, the Senator's statement serves as a reminder of the importance of thoughtful and strategic trade policies that prioritize mutually beneficial relationships with international allies.",

Additionally, citizens were given the opportunity to express their views in open meetings held across the country.\n\nAddressing the complexity of healthcare reform, Obama acknowledged that compromises would be necessary and no proposal would be perfect.

        "article": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Philando Castile had been pulled over by the police at least 52 times in recent years, an alarming statistic that has raised questions about racial profiling and enforcement practices. The 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor was often fined for minor offenses such as speeding, driving without a muffler, and not wearing a seat belt. Court records show that he was assessed over $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the 86 violations were ultimately dismissed.\n\nThe fatal shooting of Castile by a suburban St. Paul police officer during a routine traffic stop for a broken tail light has reignited the national debate on racial profiling. Castile's girlfriend live-streamed the aftermath, adding to the already tense climate after a black Army veteran killed five officers at a demonstration in Dallas the day after Castile's killing. Castile's family has alleged that he was targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops.\n\nGavin Kearney, who co-authored a report on racial profiling in Minnesota, states that assumptions and biases about black men affect how police officers interpret their actions. Kearney highlights that white drivers are less likely to be pulled over than black drivers. Although Minnesota does not require the collection of racial data on police stops and tickets, Kearney's 2001 study, using voluntarily supplied information, indicated that racial bias played a significant role in traffic stop policies and practices. The analysis found that black drivers were stopped at much higher rates than expected in suburban areas.\n\nWhile the race of the officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino, his lawyer claims that his client reacted to the fact that Castile was carrying a gun, not his race. However, Castile's girlfriend contradicts this account, stating that he was shot \"for no apparent reason\" after he reached for his ID.\n\nThe President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended that law enforcement collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches, and seizures. This would enable a better understanding of the precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more frequently than others. A national survey conducted by the U.S. Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2011 found that black drivers were pulled over at higher rates than white drivers, and they were also less likely to consider the stops legitimate.\n\nThe tragic death of Philando Castile has brought attention to the issue of racial profiling, sparking a renewed push for data collection and analysis to address this systemic problem. The case highlights the need for ongoing discussions and reform to ensure fair and impartial policing for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
