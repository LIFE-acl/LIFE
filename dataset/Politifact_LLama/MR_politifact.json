With a crowd of supporters gathered on the island, she thanked her family, friends, and the people of New York for their support throughout her political career.\n\nIn her speech, Clinton paid tribute to President Franklin Roosevelt and his Four Freedoms, emphasizing the need to continue working towards equality, economic opportunity, and civil liberties for all Americans. She highlighted the challenges facing the country, including income inequality, climate change, and a broken political system.\n\nClinton criticized the Republican party and its presidential candidates, accusing them of promoting policies that benefit the wealthy and disregard the needs of everyday Americans. She promised to implement policies that reward hard work, raise wages, and provide equal opportunities for all.\n\nClinton outlined her plans to make the economy work for every American, strengthen families, maintain America's leadership in the world, and reform the government. She stressed the importance of investing in education, infrastructure, and renewable energy to create jobs and spur economic growth.\n\nAdditionally, Clinton advocated for measures to support working families, including paid sick leave, affordable childcare, and equal pay for women. She also pledged to fight for comprehensive immigration reform, LGBT rights, and voting rights.\n\nThroughout her speech, Clinton appealed for unity and collaboration, calling on Americans from all walks of life to join her in building a better future for the country. She acknowledged that achieving progress will not be easy, but expressed confidence in the resilience and determination of the American people.\n\nClinton concluded her speech by sharing personal anecdotes and expressing her commitment to fighting for the principles and values she holds dear. She vowed to be a President for all Americans, regardless of their political affiliations or backgrounds.\n\nThe announcement marked the beginning of Clinton's second bid for the presidency, following her unsuccessful campaign in 2008.

        "text": "A new lawsuit has been filed against former President Donald Trump, accusing him of \"discriminatory animus\" towards recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This legal action comes as Trump also faces mounting scrutiny and legal challenges over various allegations, including potential indictments.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by a coalition of immigrant rights groups, argues that Trump's decision to terminate DACA was motivated by racial bias and animosity. DACA, established in 2012, protects young undocumented immigrants, commonly referred to as Dreamers, who were brought to the United States as children. The termination of DACA, an executive order issued by President Barack Obama, has been a contentious issue ever since.\n\nLegal experts supporting the plaintiffs claim that Trump's decision to revoke DACA was not based on legitimate policy concerns but rather on discriminatory prejudices against immigrants. They argue that this action violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nIn recent months, multiple court rulings have blocked efforts by the Trump administration to end DACA fully. However, the latest lawsuit seeks to hold Trump personally accountable for his alleged discriminatory actions. The plaintiffs hope that this legal action will result in a court ruling that prevents any future attempts to dismantle the program.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump faces a separate legal battle as reports suggest he could potentially be indicted on various charges. In a recent segment on her show, political commentator Rachel Maddow discussed the possibility of Trump being indicted, asserting that he knew his actions were wrongful when committing them.\n\nThe potential indictment revolves around a number of matters, including potential finance and tax-related violations. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how these allegations will be addressed within the legal system.",

        "text": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is calling on Congress to dramatically increase the hourly minimum wage. In a press conference at the Capitol, the California Democrat emphasized that the recent record-high levels of the stock market have not translated into benefits for middle-class workers. Pelosi urged Congress to address this disparity and take action to close the gap.\n\n\nPelosi pointed out, \"This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace, but we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same since the end of the Clinton years.\"\n\n\nHighlighting the need to honor the commitment to the middle class, Pelosi urged Congress to reflect this intention in public policy. She referenced a bill sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), which proposes raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years and indexing future increases to inflation.\n\n\nThe Democrats' bill goes further than President Obama's proposal of increasing the minimum wage to $9 per hour, as outlined in his February State of the Union address. Harkin recently criticized Obama, stating that he \"missed the mark\" with the lower figure.\n\n\nPelosi's plea for a minimum-wage hike coincides with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a historic high of 14,200 points. However, wages, as a percentage of the economy, remain at an all-time low (43.5 percent of GDP last year), and the nation's unemployment rate has stubbornly hovered around 8 percent for the past six months.\n\n\nEconomists attribute the lack of trickle-down benefits from corporate profits to factors such as the increasing productivity of the workforce and companies' hesitancy to hire in a still-unstable economy.\n\n\nThe last time Congress approved a minimum-wage increase was in 2007, as part of a must-pass bill that provided funds for the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was contingent upon including $5 billion in business tax breaks, and it was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.\n\n\nHowever, with the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage increase could harm hiring during a period of job crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill faces an uphill battle in the GOP-controlled House. Nevertheless, Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping that the combination of surging Wall Street gains and stagnating wages for the middle class will resonate with voters.\n\n\nPelosi concluded by saying, \"When we increased it in 2007, it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years. It's time for it to be increased again.\"\n\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://thehill.com/homenews/house/286795-pelosi-urges-minimum-wage-hike",

While some view this as an opportunity for power, Duncan emphasizes that his motivation lies in utilizing the resources to enhance opportunities for students and improve schools.\n\nDuncan plans to reward districts, charter schools, and non-profit organizations that have demonstrated success in improving student achievement, referring to them as \"islands of excellence.\" Programs that link teacher pay to classroom performance and initiatives focused on raising teacher quality, such as mentorship programs and tutoring services, are likely to receive funding support.\n\nThe stimulus funding will help states alleviate some of the education budget cuts expected for the 2009-2010 academic year, caused by the current state budget shortfalls totaling approximately $132 billion. For example, California, facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, will receive an estimated $11 billion in education funds from the stimulus package, helping to mitigate the impact on school spending.\n\nDue to the vacant deputy secretary, under secretary, chief of staff, and other senior positions at the Education Department, Duncan is relying on assistance from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to swiftly develop procedures for the quick distribution of the stimulus funds. Many of his aides have been working beyond regular office hours to organize and streamline the effort.\n\nArne Duncan's approach to his new role includes a more informal style, asking department employees to address him by his first name. By fostering open communication and collaboration, Duncan aims to create an environment that prioritizes effective use of the stimulus funds and drives impactful change in the education system.\n\nSource: The New York Times",

        "text": "The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot.\n\nThe outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.\n\nThe images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\n\nGlenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:\n\n\"Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They're supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It's the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.\"\n\nThe Cato Institute's Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:\n\n\"Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? ('This my property!' he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that 'We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone'?\"\n\nOlson added, \"the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.\"\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nMost police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.\n\nThere is a systemic problem with today's law enforcement.\n\nNot surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most Americans think of as law enforcement.\n\nThis is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation's Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, \"the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.\"\n\nBernick continued, \"federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.\"\n\nBernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, \"today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.\"\n\nWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.\n\nGiven these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\n\nThis is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.\n\nAnyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.\n\nThe militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.\n\nAmericans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.\n\nLet us continue to pray for Michael Brown's family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.\n\nPaul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.",

Obama claimed that the detention facility, located on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, continues to serve as a powerful recruitment tool for jihadists.\n\nThe former president argued that Gitmo has become a symbol of American injustice and a rallying point for extremist narratives, which only fuels the recruitment efforts of terrorist organizations. \"I believe that keeping this facility open harms our national security by fueling the propaganda that jihadists use to recruit,\" Obama stated during the interview.\n\nEver since its establishment following the 9/11 attacks, the prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a subject of controversy. Its indefinite detention of terrorism suspects without trial or charge has been widely criticized by human rights organizations and portions of the international community. Obama, during his presidency, vowed repeatedly to close the prison, as he viewed it as incompatible with American values and a recruitment tool for terrorists.\n\nAlthough he managed to reduce the detainee population significantly during his time in office, Obama's efforts to completely shut down Guantanamo were effectively thwarted by legal and political obstacles. Congress passed legislation that restricted the transfer of detainees to the United States for trial, making it nearly impossible to fulfill Obama's promise.\n\nDuring his interview, Obama acknowledged the difficulty he faced in closing the facility, but also emphasized that the negative repercussions of its continued existence should not be underestimated. He stressed the need for the United States to find alternative methods of dealing with terrorism suspects that are not only fair but also do not inadvertently contribute to the recruitment efforts of extremist groups.\n\nGitmo has long been a source of contention in the debate over national security and human rights, and Obama's comments serve as a reminder of these ongoing tensions. The issue poses a significant challenge for the Biden administration, which has also expressed a desire to eventually close the prison. Whether the closure becomes a reality or not, addressing the concerns raised by Obama remains crucial in order to effectively combat the global threat of terrorism.",

        "text": "President Donald J. Trump has issued a new executive order titled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.\" This order aims to strengthen the visa-issuance process and increase security measures to prevent foreign nationals with terrorist ties from entering the United States. The President emphasizes the importance of protecting American citizens and ensuring that those admitted to the country do not pose a threat or harbor anti-American sentiments.\n\nThe executive order highlights the need to review and enhance the visa-issuance process, considering the lessons learned from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The State Department's policies at that time failed to scrutinize the visa applications of several foreign nationals involved in the attacks, leading to the tragedy. Despite subsequent improvements to the process, the order acknowledges that these measures have not been entirely effective in preventing attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.\n\nThe order states that various individuals with ties to terrorism have been implicated in crimes within the United States, including those who entered the country through visitor, student, or employment visas, as well as those who came via the refugee resettlement program. The deteriorating conditions in certain countries have increased the risk of terrorists exploiting the immigration system to gain entry into the United States. The order asserts the need for vigilance during the visa-issuance process to ensure that approved individuals do not have any intentions to harm Americans and are not associated with terrorism.\n\nThe President emphasizes that the United States should not admit individuals who do not support the Constitution or prioritize violent ideologies over American law. Additionally, those who perpetrate acts of bigotry, hatred, violence against women, or religious persecution should not be granted entry. The country should not tolerate the oppression of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nThe executive order establishes policies to protect American citizens from foreign nationals intending to commit terrorist attacks within the United States. It also aims to prevent the exploitation of U.S. immigration laws for malicious purposes.\n\nThe order calls for a review by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to determine the necessary information for the visa adjudication process in order to verify the identity and detect potential security threats. The results of this review, including the countries that do not provide adequate information, will be submitted to the President within 30 days.\n\nTo minimize investigative burdens and enhance screening capabilities, the order implements a temporary suspension of immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States from countries listed in section 217(a)(12) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This suspension will last for 90 days, with exceptions for individuals traveling on certain diplomatic visas.\n\nThe order also directs the Secretary of State to request foreign governments that do not supply necessary information for adjudications to start providing such information within 60 days. After the 60-day period, a list of countries recommended for entry prohibition will be submitted to the President.\n\nThe Secretaries of State and Homeland Security are required to provide periodic reports to the President on the progress of implementing this order, and the Secretaries may recommend additional countries for similar treatment.\n\nThe order further emphasizes the implementation of uniform screening standards for all immigration programs. This includes the development of a uniform screening procedure, in-person interviews, identity document verification, and a mechanism to determine the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positive contributor to society.\n\nIn relation to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the order suspends the program for 120 days to allow for a review of the application and adjudication process. Additional procedures will be implemented to ensure the admission of refugees only if they do not pose a threat to national security. Priority will be given to refugees fleeing religious-based persecution, particularly if their religion is a minority in their country of nationality.\n\nThe Secretary of State is directed to provide reports on the progress of these changes within specific time frames. The resumption of USRAP admissions will only occur for nationals from countries deemed to have adequate procedures in place to ensure security and welfare.\n\nOther provisions of the order include the rescinding of exercises of authority related to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, expedited completion of a biometric entry-exit tracking system, suspension of the Visa Interview Waiver Program, review of visa validity reciprocity agreements, and the enhancement of transparency and data collection related to terrorism-related offenses and gender-based violence.\n\nThis executive order, consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, aims to safeguard American citizens from the threat of terrorism and ensure a secure and orderly immigration system that prioritizes the interests of the United States.",

However, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in 2010, 80 percent of the world's heroin came from poppy fields in Afghanistan.\n\nConsidering Portman's statement that most of the heroin in the United States comes from Mexico's border, there were initial doubts about the accuracy of this claim. Nevertheless, it seems that Portman has been diligent in studying the issue. The Drug Enforcement Administration's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 confirms Mexico as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\nAccording to the report, \"Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" and Mexico, along with Colombia to a lesser extent, dominates the U.S. heroin market due to its proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to meet the demand.\n\nThe report further highlights that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations\" pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States, with no other group presently in a position to challenge them.\n\nAdditionally, the National Drug Threat report notes that while Colombian gangs traditionally supplied wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups, Mexican cartels are increasingly taking on a larger role in the supply chain. Opium production in Mexico saw a 50 percent increase in 2014.\n\nMoreover, Mexican labs are also responsible for producing fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl is occasionally mixed with heroin or used as a substitute, resulting in over 700 reported overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015, as per the DEA.\n\nDuring a March 8 hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson confirmed that drugs mostly enter the U.S. by land rather than by sea. The Washington Post's 2015 series on the surge of heroin also reveals that the border detection rate stands at a mere 1.5 percent.\n\nThe resourcefulness of drug smugglers often defies gravity, as seen in a successful bust where agents intercepted two men attempting to fly a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nIn conclusion, Portman's claim that most heroin in the U.S. is coming from Mexico has been supported by the Drug Enforcement Administration's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015. Evidence indicates that Mexican transnational criminal organizations pose the greatest drug threat to the country, given their proximity and established infrastructure. Additionally, Mexico is witnessing an increase in opium production, while also being a source of the dangerous synthetic painkiller fentanyl.\n\nTherefore, we rate Portman's claim as True.",

Rubio claimed that Cruz had voted for a budget proposal by Rand Paul that included defense cuts greater than those proposed by Barack Obama.\n\nTo fact-check Rubio's claim, we looked into Cruz's 2013 vote in favor of Rand Paul's budget proposal. Only 18 Republican senators, including Cruz, voted in favor of the amendment, which ultimately failed. Paul's proposal aimed to reduce non-war defense spending and realign the military for the 21st century, but it still resulted in an increase in defense appropriations from 2014 to 2023.\n\nRubio's campaign considered Paul's budget as a cut to defense spending because it sought to reduce the size and scope of the military. Experts, however, argue that the budget proposal was not a true cut but rather a slower rate of increase compared to other Republican proposals and the president's budget. It should be noted that Paul's proposal for defense was still below Obama's request.\n\nFurthermore, Cruz's vote in favor of a Rubio amendment in March to boost defense spending contradicts Rubio's claim that Cruz only supported cuts. Although Rubio's larger point regarding Cruz's stance on defense may have been undermined by this vote, it does not make Rubio entirely wrong.\n\nIn light of these findings, we rate Rubio's statement as Mostly False.",

        "text": "U.S.-UNITED KINGDOM RELATIONS\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have a long-standing alliance, with no closer ally than each other. Dating back to the end of the American Revolution in 1783, the United Kingdom was one of the first countries to officially recognize American independence. Diplomatic relations were established in 1785, and apart from a brief break during the War of 1812, the two nations have remained steadfast partners and allies. This partnership forms the foundation for mutual prosperity and security.\n\nThe strong relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is rooted in their shared democratic ideals and values. Cooperation between the two countries extends to political, security, and economic issues. Together with other European allies, the United States and the United Kingdom work closely to combat terrorism, prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and ensure regional security. Both nations also coordinate efforts to address destabilizing actions by Moscow, including the war against Ukraine, election interference, cyberattacks, the use of chemical weapons, support of corrupt proxies, and human rights violations. In September 2021, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom signed the Australia, United Kingdom, and United States (AUKUS) security partnership agreement, which further solidifies security cooperation among allies.\n\nThe United States actively supports the peace process and devolved political institutions in Northern Ireland. It encourages the implementation of the 1998 Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement, which was brokered by the United States.\n\nIn addition to political and security cooperation, the United States and the United Kingdom maintain strong educational, cultural, and professional exchange programs, which further strengthen the historic bonds between the two nations. The United Kingdom is a popular study abroad destination for American students, and over 8,000 UK students studied in the United States during the 2020/21 academic year. The Fulbright Program, established in 1948, has facilitated exchanges between the United States and the United Kingdom, benefiting more than 27,000 scholars, students, and teachers. Privately funded exchange programs also bring around 17,500 UK citizens to the United States annually.\n\nU.S. assistance to the United Kingdom includes contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (IFI). This funding supports projects that sustain the peace process and encourage cross-community engagement and economic opportunities in Northern Ireland (UK) and the border counties of Ireland. The U.S. government has provided over $549 million to the IFI since its establishment in 1986.\n\nEconomically, the United States and the United Kingdom share a vibrant trade relationship, with mutual trade and investment at the core of their prosperity. Despite the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union in 2020, the United States continues to be a strong partner, focusing on advancing international trade priorities based on shared values and promoting inclusive economic growth and innovation for workers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. With the United States and the United Kingdom being the first and fifth largest economies in the world by GDP respectively, their bilateral trade in goods and services exceeded $273 billion in 2019. The two-way direct investment between the nations totals over $1.3 trillion.\n\nNotably, every U.S. state has jobs connected to UK investments, with nearly 1.3 million Americans employed by UK companies in the United States, and over 1.5 million Britons directly employed by U.S. firms. Key U.S. exports to the United Kingdom include precious metals, aircraft, machinery, financial and travel services, as well as agricultural products such as wine and beer.\n\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom take leadership roles in combating climate change. They are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United States aims to reduce emissions by 50-52 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, while the United Kingdom has set an ambitious target of slashing emissions by 78 percent by 2035. As host of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021, the United Kingdom actively collaborated with the United States and other nations to secure international commitments that enhance climate action and protect the world from the impacts of climate change.\n\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom are prominent members of various international organizations. They are two out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and are founding members of NATO. Additionally, they belong to organizations like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), G-20, G-7, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization. The United Kingdom, as a top contributor to NATO, plays a significant role in strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities against modern threats. It leads key NATO efforts in areas such as cyber defense and emerging technologies, and serves as a Framework Nation for the Enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia. The United Kingdom also has observer status in the Organization of American States and is a Dialogue Partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nIn conclusion, the United States and the United Kingdom share an exceptional alliance that has endured for over two centuries. Their relationship is grounded in democratic values and extends across political, security, economic, educational, and cultural domains. As close partners and allies, they work together to address global challenges, promote peace and prosperity, and protect the interests of their citizens.",

He stated that 90 percent of Americans support universal background checks, which would prevent dangerous individuals, such as convicted felons and those with severe mental illnesses, from purchasing firearms.\n\nThe President acknowledged that no single piece of legislation can prevent all acts of violence and evil, but emphasized that if even one life could be saved through these measures, it was the duty of Congress to act. He commended Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their bipartisan efforts in crafting a compromise that respected both Second Amendment rights and the need for stricter background checks.\n\nHowever, despite the majority of Senators voting in favor of the proposed legislation, a minority was able to block its progression. President Obama attributed this obstruction to the fear of potential political backlash from the gun lobby and its allies. He criticized the spreading of unfounded claims and lies about the bill, such as the creation of a gun registry, as tactics that influenced a vocal minority and intimidated senators who caved to pressure.\n\nThe President highlighted the families of gun violence victims, who had lobbied for this legislation, as an important voice in the debate. He dismissed critics who referred to them as \"emotional blackmail\" and emphasized their right to participate in the discussion due to their personal experiences.\n\nPresident Obama vowed to continue working to protect communities from gun violence, even without Congress' support.

The proposal seeks to grant the Treasury Department unrestricted authority to purchase distressed mortgage-related assets worth up to $700 billion from private firms.\n\nRemarkably simple in its design, the proposed plan, comprising less than three pages, would increase the national debt ceiling to $11.3 trillion. Apart from mandating semiannual reports to Congress, the proposal places no other restrictions on the administration, granting the Treasury secretary unprecedented power to buy and resell mortgage debt.\n\nPresident Bush, speaking at a news conference at the White House after a meeting with Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, emphasized the gravity of the situation, stating, “This is a big package, because it was a big problem. I will tell our citizens and continue to remind them that the risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of the package, and that, over time, we’re going to get a lot of the money back.”\n\nFollowing a week of tumultuous developments in the financial system, and with concerns still looming over global market reactions, the delivery of the administration's plan sets the stage for an intense four-day debate in Congress. While Democratic leaders have pledged to pass the bill, they argue that it must include tangible support for ordinary Americans through an economic stimulus package.\n\nOverall, while the proposed bailout plan seeks to address the urgent financial crisis, its expansive scope has ignited a contentious battle among lawmakers who must now navigate the delicate balance between stabilizing Wall Street and ensuring economic relief for everyday Americans.",

        "text": "In a speech delivered in the Rose Garden at 11:00 A.M. EDT, President [Name] placed pressure on Congress to make a choice between supporting big oil companies or standing up for the American people.\n\nHighlighting the record profits being made by oil companies and the rising prices at the gas pump, the President criticized the billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies received by the industry each year. He argued that it was unfair to burden American taxpayers with additional costs while these companies enjoyed massive profits.\n\nThe President also emphasized that the oil industry was thriving and didn't need further financial assistance. He cited the fact that the three biggest U.S. oil companies collectively earned over $80 billion in profits last year, with Exxon alone pocketing nearly $4.7 million every hour. He also mentioned that increased oil prices only resulted in higher profits for these companies.\n\nAddressing the argument in favor of subsidies, the President noted that the oil industry already pays lower tax rates than most other industries due to the billions they receive in tax giveaways. He questioned why those who dismiss investments in clean energy technologies were fighting so hard to maintain these subsidies.\n\nThe President expressed a belief that America's energy strategy should include drilling for oil, but it should also prioritize investments in clean energy technologies such as wind power, solar power, and biofuels. He called for using subsidy money to double-down on these investments, emphasizing the need to break the cycle of high gas prices and reduce dependence on other countries for oil.\n\nHighlighting that the United States only has 2 percent of the world's known oil reserves while consuming over 20 percent of the global oil supply, the President argued that increasing domestic oil production wouldn't solve the long-term energy challenge. He stressed that controlling America's own energy destiny required diversifying energy sources and reducing reliance on foreign markets.\n\nThe President concluded his speech by reiterating his commitment to an all-of-the-above energy strategy and his belief in American ingenuity and imagination. He called on Congress to vote against oil subsidies and invest in the future, emphasizing that the American people were watching and seeking faith in their representatives.\n\nThe President's remarks reflect a continuing debate regarding the role of government subsidies in the oil and gas industry and the need to prioritize clean energy investments for the future.",

        "description": "The following is the prepared text of President Obama’s speech to Congress on the need to overhaul health care, as released by the White House.",
        "text": "In a highly anticipated speech to Congress, former President Barack Obama laid out his vision for a comprehensive health care plan that aims to improve the lives of millions of Americans. Titled \"Making Health Insurance Work for You,\" the plan seeks to address several critical issues faced by individuals and businesses alike.\n\nUnder this proposed plan, insurance companies would no longer be able to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, a significant concern for many Americans. Additionally, the bill, once signed into law, would prohibit insurance companies from terminating coverage when individuals fall sick or reducing coverage when it is needed most. The implementation of arbitrary caps on coverage amounts, both yearly and throughout a lifetime, would also be deemed unlawful.\n\nRecognizing the burden of out-of-pocket expenses, the plan seeks to establish limits on the amount individuals can be charged, ensuring that no American goes bankrupt due to medical bills. Furthermore, routine check-ups and preventive care, such as mammograms and colonoscopies, would be covered by insurance companies at no additional cost. The objective is to detect diseases like breast and colon cancer at an early stage, effectively saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.\n\nFor the tens of millions of Americans currently without health insurance, the second part of the plan promises to offer quality, affordable choices. The proposal introduces a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses can compare and purchase health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies would be incentivized to participate in this exchange to cater to millions of potential customers. This approach aims to mirror the affordable insurance options enjoyed by large companies and government employees.\n\nTo ensure accessibility for those unable to afford the lower-priced insurance available through the exchange, tax credits will be provided based on individual needs. Moreover, all insurance companies seeking access to this new marketplace must abide by consumer protection regulations.\n\nHowever, disregarding the availability of affordable options, there may still be individuals, particularly the young and healthy, who choose to forgo coverage. Likewise, there may be companies that refuse to provide their workers with health care benefits. This irresponsibility has a financial cost for the rest of society. The burden often falls on taxpayers when uninsured individuals require expensive emergency room visits, and it puts businesses providing adequate healthcare at a disadvantage compared to their competitors.\n\nObama urged everyone to do their part, emphasizing that widespread participation is crucial for successful implementation of the proposed insurance reforms. Without a collective effort, crucial elements such as the coverage of pre-existing conditions would be unachievable.\n\nThe former president concluded by pressing on the importance of embracing affordable options for all Americans, emphasizing that access to proper healthcare should not be a luxury but a fundamental right. With this comprehensive plan, he aimed to provide greater security, stability, and opportunity for millions of Americans.",

She gave an answer from her heart.\"\n\nShortly after Trump's comments, Prejean herself reiterated his statement while addressing reporters. She emphasized that her views on marriage were shared not only by Obama but also by the sitting secretary of state and many other Americans. \n\nDuring the final round of the Miss USA pageant, Prejean was asked by judge Perez Hilton about her stance on same-sex marriage. Her response was as follows: \"I think in my country, in my family, I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised.\"\n\nPrejean's remarks have sparked intense debate and garnered considerable attention from both supporters and critics. While some applaud her for expressing her personal beliefs, others argue that her answer contradicts the principle of inclusivity and equality that the Miss USA competition stands for.\n\nIt is worth noting that Barack Obama himself, during his presidency, openly expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage in 2008. However, he later changed his stance and became a vocal advocate for marriage equality, ultimately supporting the legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.\n\nAs the controversy surrounding Prejean's remarks continues to unfold, it highlights the complex and deeply divisive nature of the ongoing debate on gay marriage in the United States.",

        "description": "Doctors Ezekiel Emanuel and Rep. John Fleming square off over Obamacare and how it impacts doctors....",
        "text": "When it comes to healthcare, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has been a topic of heated debate and controversy. With its aim to provide affordable and accessible healthcare to all Americans, the law has brought significant changes to the doctor-patient relationship. In this article, we will explore how Obamacare has affected you and your doctor.\n\nUnder Obamacare, one of the biggest changes is the emphasis on preventive care. Insurance plans are now required to cover certain preventive services, such as vaccinations and screenings, without cost-sharing. This means that as a patient, you have access to a wider range of preventive services, which can help detect potential health issues early on.\n\nAdditionally, Obamacare has expanded access to healthcare through the Medicaid program. Previously, eligibility for Medicaid was limited to certain low-income individuals and specific categories such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly. However, the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act extended coverage to millions of low-income adults who were previously uninsured.\n\nFor many Americans, the introduction of health insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges, has been a game-changer. These online platforms allow individuals and small businesses to compare different insurance plans and choose the one that best suits their needs and budget. Moreover, individuals who cannot afford insurance may qualify for subsidies or tax credits to help offset the cost of coverage.\n\nThe doctor-patient relationship has also undergone changes under Obamacare. With the law's focus on quality of care, doctors are encouraged to incorporate preventive measures and evidence-based practices into their treatment plans. There has been a shift towards a more collaborative approach to healthcare, with patients actively participating in decisions regarding their treatment and care.\n\nFurthermore, electronic health records (EHRs) have become an integral part of healthcare under Obamacare. The law promotes the use of EHRs to improve coordination and continuity of care. By having access to a patient's complete medical history, doctors can make more informed decisions and provide personalized care.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that the implementation of Obamacare has not been without its challenges. Some individuals have faced difficulties in finding doctors who accept their insurance plans, leading to concerns about limited provider networks. Additionally, there have been debates regarding the affordability of insurance premiums and the overall sustainability of the healthcare system.\n\nAs we continue to navigate the complex landscape of healthcare under Obamacare, it is crucial to assess both its successes and shortcomings. While the law has undoubtedly expanded access to care and placed a greater emphasis on preventive services, there are areas that still require attention and improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has brought significant changes to the doctor-patient relationship and the overall healthcare system. Through its focus on preventive care, expanded access to Medicaid, introduction of health insurance marketplaces, and emphasis on quality and collaboration in healthcare, Obamacare aims to provide affordable and accessible care for all Americans. Yet, challenges remain and continued efforts are needed to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of these reforms.",

        "text": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, is a comprehensive healthcare reform law that was enacted in 2010. The goal of the ACA is to increase access to affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans and to improve the quality and affordability of healthcare.\n\nOne of the main provisions of the ACA is the requirement for most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance. This individual mandate aims to expand coverage by ensuring that more people have insurance. Those who do not have coverage are subject to a tax penalty, which increases over time.\n\nTo help individuals and families purchase coverage, state-based American Health Benefit Exchanges were created. These exchanges provide a marketplace where individuals can compare and purchase health insurance plans. Premium and cost-sharing credits are available to individuals and families with incomes between 133-400% of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe ACA also includes requirements for employers. Larger employers with 50 or more full-time employees are required to offer health insurance to their employees or face penalties. Smaller employers with fewer than 50 employees are exempt from this requirement.\n\nMedicaid, the government program that provides health coverage for low-income individuals, was expanded under the ACA. The eligibility for Medicaid was increased to 133% of the federal poverty level, allowing more individuals to qualify for the program.\n\nThe ACA also introduced premium and cost-sharing subsidies to help individuals and families afford health insurance. These subsidies are available to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who meet income limits. The amount of the subsidy is based on a sliding scale, with lower-income individuals receiving higher subsidies.\n\nIn addition to these provisions, the ACA includes various tax changes related to health insurance and financing health reform. These changes include taxes on individuals without coverage, increased taxes on certain healthcare-related items, and tax credits for small businesses that provide health insurance to their employees.\n\nThe ACA also created health insurance exchanges, called American Health Benefit Exchanges, where individuals and small businesses can purchase qualified health coverage. These exchanges are administered by either a governmental agency or a non-profit organization.\n\nThe ACA established an essential health benefits package that provides a comprehensive set of services and covers at least 60% of the actuarial value of the covered benefits. The package is defined and updated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nOverall, the Affordable Care Act aims to improve access to healthcare coverage, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the quality of healthcare for all Americans. While it has faced ongoing debates and challenges, it remains a significant piece of legislation with a profound impact on the healthcare system in the United States.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates is considering deploying an additional 3,000 Marines to Afghanistan in order to counter any potential spring offensive by Taliban militants, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell, this proposal is currently under consideration by Secretary Gates. \"He will review it thoroughly before providing his approval,\" Morrell stated.\n\nOver the past two years, violence in Afghanistan has escalated, with the Taliban engaging in a guerilla war in the south and east, alongside high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country.\n\nIn an effort to address the escalating violence, Gates has been urging NATO allies to contribute more troops to Afghanistan. However, if the Secretary of Defense endorses this proposal, it will indicate that Washington has acknowledged the need to provide a significant proportion of additional combat forces.\n\nTo respond to the increased violence, Gates had previously ordered a surge in U.S. forces in early 2007, resulting in a record-high of 27,000 troops currently stationed in Afghanistan. Approximately half of these troops are part of the 40,000-strong NATO security assistance force, while the rest are involved in various missions, including counter-terrorism and training Afghan troops.\n\nWhile NATO claims to have thwarted last year's attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence has risen by 27 percent compared to the previous year. The southern province of Helmand has experienced a staggering 60 percent increase in violence, as reported by the U.S. military last month.\n\nGeoff Morrell stated that the majority of the additional Marines would be deployed to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian, and Dutch troops have been heavily engaged in combat. \"The aim is to have them in place by April to prevent a repeat of last spring's attempted comeback by the Taliban,\" Morrell explained. \"This deployment is a one-time, seven-month mission.\"\n\nFollowing his meeting with allies in Scotland last month, Secretary Gates hinted at a shift away from pressing NATO nations to contribute combat troops, given the political challenges they face. He suggested that allies should focus on supporting other aspects of the mission, such as rebuilding Afghanistan. This change in approach places a greater burden on the United States in terms of combat responsibilities.\n\n\"The commander on the ground requires additional forces, and since our allies are unable to provide them, we are now considering shouldering some of that additional load,\" Morrell added.\n\nThe Taliban government was ousted by U.S.-led forces in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States.\n\nMorrell mentioned that the plan to deploy the Marines would be included in a schedule of deployment proposals to be presented to Secretary Gates on Friday.\n\nThe plan involves sending a Marine Air Ground Task Force to combat the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, along with deploying a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces.\n\nAccording to a U.S. military official, the Joint Staff of the Pentagon developed this plan in response to a request from Admiral William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East. The proposal also enjoys the support of Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",

The comprehensive report, based on survey responses and data provided by CHIP directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, reveals some noteworthy findings.\n\nAccording to the report, the total number of children enrolled in CHIP reached 5.3 million in June 2011. This signifies an increase of 178,000 children from June 2010, reflecting a growth rate of 3.5 percent. Interestingly, this rate of growth is similar to the prior annual period (3.3 percent), indicating a stabilization in enrollment growth since the onset of the recession.\n\nWhile the number of children accessing CHIP continues to rise steadily, it appears that the rate of enrollment growth has somewhat moderated in recent times. This observation suggests that the economic downturn has had some impact on the program, potentially limiting its expansion during the analyzed period.\n\nThe report's findings highlight the significance of CHIP in providing healthcare coverage to children across the United States. As a crucial lifeline for families, CHIP plays a vital role in ensuring access to affordable healthcare, particularly for those who might not qualify for Medicaid but still require essential medical services for their children.\n\nAs the nation continues to grapple with the effects of economic uncertainty, it is essential that policymakers and healthcare stakeholders assess the CHIP program's efficacy and address any barriers to enrollment growth. Strengthening CHIP's reach and impact is paramount to guaranteeing that all children have access to the healthcare they deserve.\n\nTo gain a more in-depth understanding of the data presented in this report, please refer to the attached Data Snapshot (.pdf).\n\nThis news article underscores the ongoing importance of CHIP in offering healthcare coverage to millions of children nationwide.

However, tensions have risen on the job site after billionaire developer Donald Trump, the man behind the project, made controversial comments about illegal immigration while launching his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. This has left some of the workers concerned about their job security and others disgusted by the opinions of the man responsible for creating those jobs.\n\nAccording to several workers at the site, it is possible that some of the construction workers, who are undocumented immigrants, were hired by a Trump company to finish the $200 million hotel. While a Trump spokeswoman has stated that the company and its contractors abide by all applicable laws, the workers are now worried about the repercussions of Trump's comments. They argue that they have lived honest lives, worked hard, and contributed to the local community, including buying homes and raising U.S.-born children.\n\nSeveral of the laborers, who come from countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, have become U.S. citizens or obtained legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly admitted that they remain in the country illegally.\n\nThe concern among the workers is that Trump's comments could escalate into a bigger problem and potentially lead to their termination. Some workers even expressed the fear of being told to \"get the heck out of here\" by Trump himself. They argue that they risk their lives and health on the job site, and Trump's comments do not accurately reflect their hard work and dedication.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, emphasized that the company and its contractors follow all immigration laws when hiring workers.

        "text": "ent: \n\nThe first presidential debate of the 2012 campaign season took place on Wednesday night at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. The debate was moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS NewsHour and focused on domestic issues. President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, faced off in a 90-minute discussion.\n\nThe debate began with a discussion on the economy and the candidates' plans to create jobs. President Obama highlighted his administration's accomplishments in job creation, including the revival of the auto industry and the rise in housing. He emphasized the need to invest in education, develop new sources of energy, and reduce the deficit in a balanced way.\n\nGovernor Romney outlined his plan to boost American energy production, crack down on China's unfair trade practices, improve education, and champion small businesses. He disagreed with President Obama's tax plan, stating that he would not reduce taxes for high-income individuals and that his number one priority was job growth.\n\nThe discussion then shifted to the topic of taxes and the deficit. President Obama criticized Governor Romney's tax plan, stating that it would add $5 trillion to the deficit and burden the middle class. He highlighted the need for a balanced approach that includes both spending cuts and revenue increases. Governor Romney countered by stating that he did not have a $5 trillion tax cut and that his plan would not add to the deficit. He emphasized the importance of cutting spending, lowering taxes, and growing the economy.\n\nThe debate concluded with a discussion on the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan. Governor Romney stated that he had his own plan and criticized President Obama for not adopting the Simpson-Bowles plan during his presidency. President Obama defended his approach, stating that he had made adjustments to the plan and was currently putting it forward before Congress.\n\nOverall, the debate highlighted the candidates' differing approaches to job creation, taxes, and deficit reduction. It allowed voters to compare and contrast their plans for the future of the country.",

        "text": "April 18, 2010 — Former President Bill Clinton recently granted an exclusive interview with \"This Week,\" where he addressed various topics including his mistakes as president, the dangers of political rhetoric, Supreme Court nominations, Middle East peace negotiations, and the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nOne of the main topics discussed was the recent accusation by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh that Clinton \"set the stage for violence\" with a speech regarding political rhetoric. Clinton firmly dismissed Limbaugh's accusation, stating that it \"doesn't make any sense.\" He emphasized that while political dissent and argument are crucial in democracy, individuals must also take responsibility for the potential consequences of their words. Clinton expressed concern about threats against President Obama and Congress, cautioning against careless language that could incite violence.\n\nReflecting on his presidency, Clinton admitted to making mistakes in relation to financial regulation. He acknowledged that he was wrong to have taken the advice of his Treasury secretaries, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, on the issue of unregulated financial instruments called derivatives. Clinton now recognizes that their argument, which claimed that derivatives did not require further regulation due to being expensive and limited to a small group of sophisticated investors, was flawed. He expressed regret for not attempting to regulate derivatives during his time in office, attributing the lack of action to the Republican majority in Congress.\n\nRegarding the nomination of the next Supreme Court justice, Clinton offered advice to President Obama. He suggested that a robe should not be a requirement for the position, stating that it is important for the nominee to be smart, competent, and understand the lives of ordinary people. Clinton recommended considering diversity in the selection process, including representation of different religions and genders on the court.\n\nClinton expressed his satisfaction with the passage of the health care reform bill, likening his feelings to how Teddy Roosevelt would have felt seeing his cousin Franklin sign legislation in areas he had advocated. He and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, personally lobbied for the passage of the bill.\n\nCommenting on the upcoming midterm elections, Clinton drew parallels to the political climate of 1994 when Democrats faced major losses in Congress. While he acknowledged the intense political dissent, he predicted that the outcome of the election would be less dramatic than in '94, stating that he did not believe Republicans would win either house.\n\nIn terms of the Middle East peace process, Clinton refrained from giving public advice to President Obama to keep his options open, but stressed the need to push both sides to engage in serious negotiations. He expressed his willingness to strongly support any peace plan proposed by the administration, even if it faced resistance.\n\nIn conclusion, Bill Clinton's interview covered a range of topics, from admitting to mistakes in financial regulation to discussing the dangers of political rhetoric and offering advice on the Supreme Court nomination, Middle East peace process, and upcoming midterm elections.",

        "text": "UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, warmly welcomes the news of the 10,000th Syrian refugee settling in the United States this week and urges greater global solidarity ahead of upcoming summits focused on addressing the unprecedented refugee crisis worldwide.\n\nAcknowledging the United States' longstanding tradition of offering sanctuary to people fleeing persecution, Shelly Pitterman, the UNHCR Regional Representative in the United States, commended the nation's leadership, stating, \"The arrival of the 10,000th Syrian refugee marks yet another testament to this exemplary initiative.\"\n\nExpressing gratitude towards the communities in the United States that have willingly opened their doors, Pitterman also recognized the tireless efforts of civil society partners in facilitating humanitarian aid. Nonetheless, he emphasized the urgent need for increased support for Syrian refugees and the global crisis, which has witnessed an unparalleled number of individuals seeking refuge from persecution.\n\nAs of the end of 2015, a staggering 65.3 million people, driven by war, conflict, and persecution, were forcibly displaced worldwide—a record high. Among them, the Syrian refugee crisis stands as the most extensive, with over 4.8 million Syrians seeking sanctuary in neighboring countries. Regrettably, these host countries are already strained, causing an increasing number of refugees to live below national poverty lines.\n\nTo assist the most vulnerable amongst the displaced population and to alleviate some of the burden on countries hosting refugees, UNHCR has called upon governments to offer resettlement to those facing the highest risks. Thus far, resettlement countries have pledged more than 220,000 places for Syrians through resettlement and other humanitarian admission programs. It is estimated that approximately 40 percent of the 1.19 million refugees globally requiring resettlement—roughly 478,000 Syrians—are in urgent need of a new home.\n\nRecognizing the limited opportunities for resettlement, UNHCR reserves this option for individuals who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and those with special medical needs. In an effort to ensure the safety and security of all refugees accepted for resettlement, the UNHCR meticulously screens and identifies suitable candidates before referring them to their receiving country. In the case of the United States, all referred refugees undergo a rigorous process, including face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, extensive identity checks, and multiple security screenings.\n\nUNHCR urges a collective global effort to provide Syrian refugees with more safe and regular pathways for admission. The upcoming United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on September 19th and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on September 20th will provide platforms for countries to demonstrate solidarity with refugee-hosting nations worldwide by offering legal avenues for Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups to access safety and protection through resettlement and other admission programs.\n\n\"Resettlement, supported by continued humanitarian funding, is a vital form of solidarity with countries hosting refugees and should be expanded on a global scale,\" emphasized Pitterman.",

        "text": "Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back with a claim that he provides universal health care. However, a closer look at his plan reveals that it falls short of a guaranteed universal coverage.\n\nBoth Democratic presidential candidates share a lot in common when it comes to health care, but one key difference is Clinton's inclusion of a universal mandate. This means that individuals would be legally required to purchase health insurance. Obama's plan, on the other hand, only includes a mandate to insure children and lacks a mandate for adults, similar to the plans proposed by Clinton and Edwards. According to health policy expert Kenneth Thorpe, this difference is likely to result in fewer people being insured under Obama's plan.\n\nObama's decision to exclude a mandate for adults is seen as a more cautious approach to avoid penalizing those with modest incomes. If premiums do not decrease significantly after implementing reforms, these individuals may still be unable to afford insurance. Obama argues that mandating them to buy insurance, and subsequently fining them if they don't comply, would only punish the poor and leave them uninsured. Instead, he believes that his plan will lower costs enough to persuade a large number of the estimated 47 million uninsured Americans to voluntarily sign up, with a mandate potentially being added later on.\n\nAlthough Obama claims his plan will create market conditions for universal availability of health care, it does not guarantee it. While his approach may lead to increased coverage, nothing in his plan provides an assurance of universal health care. Therefore, his claim is considered Barely True.",

        "description": "When China destroyed its own satellite, outrageand debrisrapidly encircled the globe. Was the Sat Kill a policy weapon or the start of an arms race in space?",
        "text": "At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small—just 6 ft. long—a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.\n\nIt was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and—boom—obliterated it. \"It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,\" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.\n\nFor China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. \"The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,\" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. \"China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there.\" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of anti-satellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.\n\nINTERNATIONAL THREAT\n\nFor many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. \"Space debris is a huge problem,\" says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"A 1-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed.\" Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as 35,000 of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the 1-cm range. Nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger.\n\nAlthough the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officials—reluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillance—chose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these 33-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth.\n\nBattlefield: Space Media Platforms Design Team\n\n1] Songlin test facility, near Xichang, Sichuan province, China. Publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by China prior to the test; immediately following, they were declassified.\n\n2] Experts believe a four-stage, solidÂ­-fuel launch vehicle—thought by American officials to be based on China's KT-2—boosted the kill vehicle into orbit.\n\n3] The Feng-Yun 1C target vehicle was launched May 10, 1999, with a two-year active life span. The 1650-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation.\n\n4] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18,000 mph when it struck the satellite.\n\n5] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within 7 hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe.\n\nSome details of China's ASAT test are classified. Our artist relied on published reports, declassified information, and comparable technology to create this graphic. The Chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. (Diagram by Golden Section Graphics. Inset satellite photograph by Digital Globe.)\n\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n\nAMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS\n\nEvery industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television, and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones.\n\nSome satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft—including spy sats—are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile—yet it can be done. \"You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,\" says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. \"You'd need ICBM-size boosters—hundreds of them.\"\n\nSuch an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. \"There'd be so much debris up there,\" Clark says, \"that it wouldn't be safe to put anything up in space.\"\n\nThe United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War, spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. \"The consensus,\" Clark says, \"was that anybody could look at anybody else.\"\n\nDiagram: China's anti-satellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in 1962, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles. The explosion, which occurred about 800 miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites—roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately.\n\nTo develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May 23, 1963, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles.\n\nOver the next several decades, the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In 1985, the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-15 fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was canceled before the air-launched system could be perfected.\n\nThat same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In 1997, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year.\n\nSome $400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle—a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high.\n\nDestroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at GlobalSecurity says, \"It's an act of war.\"\n\nU.S. Sat Kill Arsenal\n\n- Perhaps the most spectacular test—known as Starfish Prime—occurred on July 9, 1962, when a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for 20 minutes.\n\n- The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985 when an F-15 climbed to 80,000 ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a 17,500-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n\n- In 1997, the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy and eventually canceled the program.\n\n- The XSS-11 microsatellite isn't an antisat—but it could be. First launched in April 2005, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it wouldn't be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets.\n\nSENDING A MESSAGE\n\nSo why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. \"The experiment is not targeted at any other country,\" said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing.\n\nSome experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that \"The United States considers space capabilities... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests.\"\n\nThe United States \"basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies,\" Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: \"Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state.\"\n\nIn that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. \"The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties,\" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. \"For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength.\"\n\nPike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island.\n\n\"The Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real,\" Pike says. \"Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there won't be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time.\" A half-dozen sats, Pike says—that's all it would take. \"Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nIn that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its war plan is feasible.\n\nAMERICA'S TRUMP CARD\n\nThe long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. \"It was a mistake,\" O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, \"It doesn't help China's case saying it isn't a threatening military power,\" Vick says. \"It is a threat, and the test showed that.\" Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat, and China has only 60 satellites—few of these are worth shooting down.\n\nAmerica's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all—they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, \"just nothing to shoot at.\"\n\nFor now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier.\n\nWaste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude.\n\nJULY 2007 The debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles.\n\nJANUARY 2008 A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from 10-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites.\n\nIt's called the Kessler Syndrome—the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. \"Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay,\" says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. \"We can't track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know.\" The graphic at left illustrates the density of junk in orbit up to an altitude of 22,000 miles—and Kessler's looming threat.",

        "text": "In an exclusive interview with ABC News on February 4, 2011, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky expressed his dissatisfaction with the House GOP budget proposal, stating that it falls short in addressing the federal deficit.\n\nAccording to Paul, the plan put forward by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin does not adequately tackle the issue at hand. He noted a disconnect among Republicans, stating that while they advocate for a balanced budget, they may not be ready to discuss the necessary spending cuts.\n\nReleased on Thursday, Ryan's proposal aims to cut non-security discretionary spending by $58 billion by the end of the fiscal year 2011, which concludes on September 30.\n\nDuring the extensive interview conducted aboard the Capitol Subway, Paul declared himself a \"true believer\" and expressed his commitment to the principles of the Tea Party movement. He emphasized that his dedication to these values supersedes his affiliation with the Republican party. Additionally, Paul did not rule out the possibility of running for president in the future and suggested a potential reduction in U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nPaul has presented his own plan to slash spending by $500 billion in the current year. His proposal includes significant across-the-board cuts, such as an 83 percent reduction in funding for the Department of Education, a 6 percent reduction for the Department of Defense, and an elimination of all foreign aid. However, Paul views these cuts as merely a starting point.\n\nPaul shared feedback he has received at tea party events, where attendees consistently demand more substantial action. He said they express their concerns, stating, \"It's not enough. It's not enough. Where's the other trillion you need?\"\n\nWhile defending his position on ending all foreign aid, including the $3 billion given annually to Israel, Paul clarified that he remains supportive of the country. However, he stressed that it is not prudent to borrow money to provide assistance, even to friendly nations.\n\nAddressing critics who argue against discontinuing aid to Israel, Paul maintained that the country possesses sufficient resources to sustain itself economically. He stated, \"I think they're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I don't think so.\"\n\nPaul also praised Israel's military capabilities, stating they outmatch those of their neighboring countries. \"I think they're probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country. I think that their defense is very significant and probably well in advance of any of their particular enemies,\" he remarked.\n\nRegarding troop levels in Afghanistan, Paul expressed his belief that the decision falls within the purview of the president. However, he personally believes that a smaller presence would be sufficient.\n\nClearing any confusion about his political affiliations, Paul asserted that he prioritizes being a Tea Party activist over identifying as a Republican. He emphasized that certain issues in the nation's capital transcend party lines, stating, \"There are always problems in our nation's capital that are more important than party affiliation, and I will always believe that.\" When questioned about the importance of party loyalty, Paul firmly responded, \"If you ask me what's more important, tackling our nation's deficit, our nation's debt problems or being a Republican, I would say tackling the debt.\"",

        "description": "Donald Trump said “hedge fund guys are getting away with murder” when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break.",
        "text": "President Donald Trump’s recent rhetoric on implementing stricter taxes for hedge funds may not align with his actual plan, raising concerns about the effectiveness of his proposed measures.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign and even after taking office, Trump repeatedly criticized the hedge-fund industry, claiming that it exploits tax loopholes and benefits from preferential treatment. He vowed to close these loopholes and make hedge funds pay their fair share of taxes.\n\nHowever, a closer analysis of Trump's tax plan reveals a different story. Rather than cracking down on hedge-fund tax practices, his proposed reforms primarily focus on lowering corporate tax rates and providing relief for high-income individuals. This discrepancy begs the question: is Trump's tough talk on hedge-fund taxes nothing more than political posturing?\n\nWhile the proposed reforms might have positive impacts on the overall economy, critics argue that they do not address the specific issues surrounding hedge-fund taxation. The lack of specific measures targeting this industry raises doubts about Trump's commitment to tackling the concerns he previously expressed.\n\nHedge funds are known for utilizing complex strategies to minimize their tax obligations legally. Critics argue that these practices allow hedge-fund managers to pay lower effective tax rates compared to many middle-class Americans. This income inequality has fueled public anger and calls for reform.\n\nThe tension between Trump's tough rhetoric and his actual plan is further amplified by the presence of former hedge-fund managers within his administration. Critics argue that influential figures from the industry, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, may influence policy decisions in favor of their former colleagues instead of implementing reforms.\n\nAs the President continues to push for his ambitious tax reforms, it remains to be seen whether he will truly address the concerns surrounding hedge-fund taxes. Trump's tough talk may have garnered attention, but its alignment with his actual plan is still questionable.\n\nA comprehensive and fair tax system requires a diligent and genuine effort to close any loopholes that allow certain industries to disproportionately benefit. Only time will tell if the President's words will translate into meaningful action or if his tough talk on hedge-fund taxes is merely political rhetoric aimed at appeasing the public.",

        "text": "Of all the major Republicans, the one who comes closest to my worldview is Newt Gingrich. Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism, and social mobility.\n\nIn a 2007 statement, Gingrich declared his political ideology, stating, \"It's not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.\"\n\nGingrich highlights key instances in American history to support his viewpoint. He references how the government provided railroad land grants to encourage the widespread adoption of a modern transportation system. Similarly, the Homestead Act gave away land to those willing to live on and develop it. Gingrich further points out that public-private partnerships were employed to bring telephone service and electricity to all communities in the nation. These examples demonstrate how government involvement can serve public purposes without leading to excessive bureaucracy.\n\nThis consistent theme in Gingrich's career sets him apart, highlighted by his 1984 book, \"Window of Opportunity.\" In the book, he vehemently criticizes the \"laissez-faire\" conservatism, which promotes the idea that the government should step back and let the market flourish. Gingrich argues that an opportunity society requires active government intervention to foster growth and provide equal opportunities.\n\nDespite facing criticism and encountering tumultuous political phases, Gingrich's unwavering belief in the power of limited government intervention to drive growth and social progress remains a defining aspect of his philosophy.",

Keene has rejected White House recommendations on gun control and dismissed any ban on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines.",
        "text": "JUDY WOODRUFF: We come back now to the gun story. And we're joined by David Keene, president of the National Rifle Association. Welcome to the NewsHour.\n\nDAVID KEENE: Thank you for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said that critics who argue that gun control measures are an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He argued that these measures are simply commonsense safety measures. What is your response to that?\n\nDAVID KEENE: I believe that gun control measures are indeed an attack on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. These measures infringe upon the rights of those who have legally purchased and use firearms and have never committed a criminal act. While every amendment, including the Second Amendment, is subject to reasonable limits, the proposed gun control measures have not been proven to have a significant impact on preventing tragedies like the one in Connecticut. We need to focus on preventing these incidents rather than imposing unnecessary restrictions on law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly recently wrote an op-ed article arguing for stricter gun control measures. How do you respond to their arguments?\n\nDAVID KEENE: They specifically mentioned assault weapons, but it's important to note that assault weapons were not involved in the Giffords shooting. The AR-15, often referred to as an assault weapon, is a semiautomatic commercial rifle and the bestselling long gun in the United States. It is used by many for sport shooting and hunting. Banning these rifles based on cosmetic features would be an infringement on the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What about the argument that reducing high-capacity ammunition clips and implementing a ban on assault weapons could help reduce gun violence?\n\nDAVID KEENE: We have tried a ban on assault weapons before, and it did not make a significant difference. Additionally, there is no functional difference between an assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle. Banning them based on cosmetic features would not address the issue. Instead, we should focus on keeping firearms out of the hands of individuals who should not have them, such as those who have been adjudicated as potentially violent or mentally ill. Strengthening our background check system and addressing mental health issues can be effective ways to address gun violence without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any common ground between the NRA and the White House on gun control measures?\n\nDAVID KEENE: There is some potential for common ground, such as implementing background checks for individuals who have been adjudicated as potentially violent. The NRA has been advocating for this for the past 20 years. However, we do not support banning rifles that we believe would not make a significant difference in preventing gun violence. We also oppose the creation of a national gun registry.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Recent polls show that even in gun-owning households, there is support for measures such as reducing high-capacity ammunition clips and implementing background checks. How do you respond to these findings?\n\nDAVID KEENE: The Gallup poll actually showed no change in support for a ban on \"assault weapons.\" This indicates that people are more informed than politicians give them credit for. While there may be initial support for these measures, I believe that as the discussion evolves, people will recognize the importance of protecting Second Amendment rights while also preventing gun violence through more effective means like stronger background checks and addressing mental health issues.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you for joining us, David Keene, president of the NRA.\n\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, thank you.",
        "title": "JUDY WOODRUFF: We come back now to the gun story.\nAnd we're joined by David Keene. He's president of the National Rifle Association.\nWelcome to the NewsHour.\nDAVID KEENE, National Rifle Association: Thank you for having me.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said the critics who argue that what they're trying to do by limiting gun violence and say that it's an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He said, what we're simply doing are commonsense safety measures.\nDAVID KEENE: That's what Michael Bloomberg says.\nNo, it is an attack on the Second Amendment. It is an attack on those Americans who purchased and legally use firearms, who have never committed a criminal act, who have never done anything wrong. And they can say that it doesn't infringe upon their rights, but, in fact, it does.\nNow, every amendment -- the First Amendment -- you can't, famously, yell fire in a crowded theater. The Second Amendment is also subject to reasonable limits. The Supreme Court has held that. But they're strictly looked at. And you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that they're really necessary. And the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good. They're asking the question, Judy, what do we do about guns? The question should be, what do we do to prevent the kinds of things that happened in Connecticut?\nAnd we don't think that they're asking that question, but they're pursuing their own agenda.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say that's what they're doing.\nDAVID KEENE: I know they do.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And let me just quickly read from something that Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was gravely wounded. Mark Kelly, her husband. They wrote an op-ed article just a few days ago. They say, people who are just -- he said: \"Special interests have cast -- have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties.\"\nAnd they say, as a result, more people are vulnerable to gun violence.\nDAVID KEENE: You know, they're talking about what they call assault weapons. Actually, an assault weapon, so-called, wasn't involved in the Giffords shooting.\nBut the fact of the matter is that we have heard time and time again that these are military weapons designed for the battlefield. They're not. They're semiautomatic commercial rifles. The AR-15 is the bestselling long gun in the United States. There are over three million of them that have been purchased by people.\nMost people that have them use them for sport shooting, for hunting and for the like. And to take those guns away from them for no reason is an infringement on their rights.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, the mother of one of the victims in Aurora, Colo., was visiting Newtown just yesterday, and she specifically talked about the AR-15, these assault weapons.\nAnd she said, they don't belong in the hands of people in the community. What do you say to what -- her name is...\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... Phillips.\nDAVID KEENE: It was interesting, Judy, because...\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say to her?\nDAVID KEENE: ... because we're talking -- anybody who dies in a tragedy, whether it's an auto accident or beaten to death or knifed or killed by a gun, it is tragic. And I can understand her reaction to that.\nBut, in this country, last year, more people were, in fact, beaten to death than killed by all long arms, including assault, so-called assault weapons. The semiautomatic rifle has been in this country and available to people since 1806.\nIn our museum, we have got one that fired 20 rounds from a magazine, a magazine that would be banned by some people, that Lewis and Clark took with them on their expedition.\nIt's been that long. And we're talking -- we're talking about something that has no impact. We have tried to do that as a society before. It hasn't made any difference.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we can argue about the statistics. I mean, what is out there...\nDAVID KEENE: Right. People do that.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... 70 percent of the violent deaths last year were due -- had a gun involved.\nBut, specifically, David Keene, what about what we're hearing from the president, that there is going to be an attempt to ban the assault weapon, that there will be a proposal for comprehensive background checks? Is there -- where -- is there any common ground between the position of the NRA and the White House?\nDAVID KEENE: Yes, there is some common ground.\nIt's not on banning rifles that we don't think would make any difference. And it's not on setting up a national gun registry.\nBut we have for 20 years been asking that those people who have been adjudicated to be mentally potentially violent be put on the lists of people who are not allowed to buy firearms.\nWhen you go into a store to buy a gun, or if you go to a gun show to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they have to check your background. The FBI keeps databases of people who are not allowed to buy guns, felons, and the like. We have been urging that these people be put on these lists. And nothing has happened.\nTwenty-three states don't put any on the list. Now, one of the things we have to do is keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do that partly in that way. The problem is, you can never predict in a society who is going to do what.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\nDAVID KEENE: So, you also have to provide security. And that's what we have been proposing in terms of the schools.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And that's why -- and that's -- and you mentioned mental illness. And that is something the administration is going to talk about.\nMaybe there's some common ground there. When it comes to guards, putting armed guards, Gov. Markell said earlier on the program that -- he said, how would you know where to put a guard, how many to put? He said it's really an impractical thing to...\nDAVID KEENE: Sure.\nWell, I don't think that it's impractical. You know, just by coincidence, I was in Israel the day after the Newtown shooting. And I was touring a facility where they, in fact, train guards for their schools, because they had a spate of shootings in the 1970s.\nTheir crazy people are a little different from ours, but the results were the same. And they first used volunteers.\nNow each school provides its own through private security guards. And I was in a place where they train these people. It works there. It was a sensible thing for them to do.\nAfter Columbine, President Clinton proposed what he called the COPS program. And about 28,000 schools in this country now either have police through that program or police that are paid for by the state or private security guards. Those schools have them.\nNow, and it is -- there's an argument -- the argument against it is just what you said. But the fact is, if you look at the people who do this, first of all, they're mentally deranged. And, secondly, they're cowards. And the fact that there's somebody armed there will prevent them in most cases from doing anything.\nCan you -- do we live in a perfect world? No. But we can do what makes sense to protect our kids.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of what's not perfect, what about trying some of the solutions that the folks who are saying they're not trying to attack the Second Amendment are saying? They simply want to make -- they want to reduce gun violence.\nWhy not try reducing high-capacity ammunition clips? Why not try a ban on assault weapons?\nDAVID KEENE: Well, we tried a ban on assault weapons. The only thing that is different is -- and, remember, Judy, that an assault weapon has to be listed because there's no functional difference between a so-called assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle.\nSo, this time, they're saying, well, if it has a pistol grip, it's dangerous. If it doesn't have a pistol grip, it isn't dangerous. Now, that's absurd from a functional standpoint, because it's the same gun, the same rifle. And the only difference is cosmetic.\nSo, banning something for cosmetic reasons is not going to cause -- is not going to cure the problem.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not saying there's -- couldn't reasonable people sit down at the table and come up with a solution that would satisfy you, your organization and would satisfy those who say, we have got to make it safer?\nDAVID KEENE: That's why we went to the meeting with Vice President Biden.\nBut, you know, before that meeting, the vice president himself and those speaking for him said, we're open-minded. We're going to discuss this. We got to the meeting.\nAnd one of the first things he said was, the president and I have strong feelings about firearms, and nobody is going to change our mind on that. We're going to pursue what we want to pursue.\nFine. They had the meeting, so they could say, oh, and we talked to the NRA.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I happened to talk to someone in the White House, because I had heard you say something similar to that in another interview. And they say that's not what was said in the meeting.\nDAVID KEENE: Well, it is.\nAnd the other thing -- let me say one other thing. In the last year, 77,000 people who were on the prohibited list tried to buy firearms. That, in itself, is a crime. You know how many have been prosecuted? Seventy.\nWhen that was raised at the meeting, the attorney general said, well, we don't have the resources and the time to be going after those people. Those people are the potential criminals whom we're trying to keep guns out of the hands of, but the government doesn't have time to do anything about them. They do have time to try and prohibit legitimate citizens from owning firearms.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, David Keene, the new polls show that are out that show even in gun-owning households people are saying by large percentages we need to do something about, again, high-capacity ammunition clips, assault weapons, background checks?\nDAVID KEENE: Well, actually, interestingly, the Gallup poll showed no change at all on the so-called assault weapon question. I consider that evidence of the fact that people are smarter than politicians.\nBut given the publicity and everything, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more of an immediate reaction.\nBut when we get into this, when we begin to discuss it -- and remember it's sort of deja vu, because we have had this discussion before. Once the discussion takes place and people think about the substance of it, I'm confident that the judgment of the American people is going to be as it was before.\nAnd that is that Second Amendment rights should be protected. Criminals should be prosecuted. And we should strengthen the ways we keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business buying them.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: David Keene, president of the NRA, we thank you for being with us tonight.\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, as always. Thank you."

        "text": "By Sen. Rand Paul\n\nRumors have been circulating that President-elect Donald Trump is considering John Bolton for the position of Secretary of State. As an opponent of the Iraq war and regime change, I am concerned about this potential appointment and whether it aligns with Trump's previous stance on these issues.\n\nOne of the reasons I admired Trump during his campaign was his understanding of the mistakes made during the Iraq war and how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East, ultimately empowering Iran. However, John Bolton, a longtime member of the Washington elite, has failed to learn from these mistakes, and it is unlikely that he will do so in the future.\n\nBolton stood in opposition to Trump's advice on numerous occasions, and his foreign policy views are reminiscent of the failed policies of the past 15 years. He was a vocal supporter of overthrowing Saddam Hussein, even going so far as to say that the decision was correct 13 years after the fact. In contrast, Trump recognizes that the Iraq war destabilized the region and facilitated the rise of ISIS.\n\nFurthermore, Bolton has expressed his desire to pursue regime change in countries like Syria and Iran, similar to the failed approach in Iraq. It is clear that he has not learned from past mistakes and is out of touch with the reality in the Middle East. His lack of nuance and his insistence on all-out war make him a dangerous candidate for the position of Secretary of State.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bolton, like many of his generation, avoided serving in the military when the Vietnam draft was in effect, citing a lack of desire to die in Southeast Asia. Yet, he appears to have no qualms about sending other people's sons and daughters into harm's way.\n\nIn a time when Americans are looking for change and new thinking, Bolton represents failed foreign policy and is a menace to our national security. It is important to remember that our Constitution explicitly states that war should not be fought without the permission of Congress. As a senator, I will fulfill my constitutional duty by opposing any advocate for war, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nPresident-elect Trump campaigned on the promise to change our foreign policy, and appointing John Bolton would be a significant step back from that promise. I urge the incoming administration to reconsider this appointment and instead choose a Secretary of State who truly aligns with the desire for change and a more thoughtful approach to foreign policy.\n\nRand Paul is the junior senator from Kentucky.",

        "text": "The recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation.\n\nDuring the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law.\n\nAs it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan.\n\nOn the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. \"Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?\" she asked.\n\nBrown responded, \"In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done.\"\n\nWhen Walters asked him, \"Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?\" Brown said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"The whole plan?\" Walters continued.\n\n\"Yes,\" Brown said.\n\nLater, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response.\n\n\"That was the most evasive answer,\" Krugman said. \"If you think this is a straightforward guy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care, because the Senate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print is there any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majority of voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of the Massachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead.\"\n\nWe wanted to see whether the Massachusetts plan was indeed \"the same thing\" as the bill passed by the U.S. Senate. So we looked at the details of both plans and consulted with an ideologically diverse group of health policy experts.\n\nThe consensus among our experts was that Krugman is basically right on the overall structure, although some of the details differ. As Elizabeth A. McGlynn, associate director of RAND Health, put it, \"Same recipe, different amounts on the ingredients.\"\n\nHere are elements of the two plans that are broadly the same, along with some of the differences in details:\n\n• Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the Senate plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.\n\n• Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The Senate bill sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill falls short of a mandate.\n\n• Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and U.S. Senate plans involve the use of voluntary \"exchanges\" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.\n\n• Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the U.S. Senate plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n• Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The U.S. Senate plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n• Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. In Massachusetts, the reform bill merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, it merged the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan with the market serving smaller employers). The U.S. Senate bill placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the U.S. Senate bill allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the U.S. Senate bill creates a category of lower-cost, lower-benefit plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage.\n\n• Limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums. In Massachusetts, the highest premiums can generally only be twice as high as the lowest premiums. The only factors that can be used to vary premiums are age, tobacco use, geographic area, the nature of the employee's industry, an unusually low participation rate (for group plans) and participation in a wellness plan. The U.S. Senate bill allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchange to vary based only on age (limited to a 3-to-1 ratio), geographic area, family composition and tobacco use (limited to 1.5-to-1 ratio). Wellness programs do not factor into ratings variations under the Senate bill, but the bill does provide other incentives for such plans.\n\nThe bills differ more noticeably in several other areas.\n\n• Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The U.S. Senate bill makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. The U.S. Senate bill also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic versions of certain drugs. This, too, is a federal rather than a state responsibility.\n\n• Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and the Senate bill are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the Senate bill, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers, and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (\"Cadillac\") healthcare plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things.\n\n\"The Senate probably has more cost containment,\" said John Holahan, a health expert at the Urban Institute who has studied the Massachusetts plan extensively. \"And the financing is different. But the structure is the same.\"\n\nSo it seems that there's broad agreement that, despite some operational differences, the broad structure of the Massachusetts health care plan is quite similar to that in the U.S. Senate bill -- certainly more similar than either one is to, say, a single-payer health care plan or even to the current system. Krugman's comparison of the two plans is Mostly True.",

        "text": "In the fifth part of the second Democratic primary debate, the candidates delved into personal topics such as the Black Lives Matter movement, Hillary Clinton's email scandal, and Bernie Sanders' ability to win over conservatives.\n\nDuring the debate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received laughter and applause for defending his progressive tax policy. When asked how he would fund proposals like tuition-free college for Americans, Sanders responded that he would finance them by making the wealthiest people and largest corporations pay their fair share, as they have benefited disproportionately for years.\n\nWhen CBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes pressed Sanders for specifics, asking how high he would go with taxes, Sanders replied that they had not determined an exact number yet, but it would be lower than the 90 percent tax rate under President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nSanders emphasized that his administration would address the absurdity of billionaires paying a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers. He believes in real tax reform where the wealthiest individuals and corporations contribute their fair share.\n\nDuring Eisenhower's first term as president, the highest marginal tax rate on regular income for individuals earning over $400,000 was 92 percent. This rate was carried over from President Harry Truman's administration, and it constituted the second-highest tax rate in the 20th century. In 1954, the highest bracket rate was reduced to 91 percent.\n\nBased on these historical tax rates, Sanders' claim that he is not as \"socialist\" as Eisenhower is accurate. Although he hasn't provided an exact number, Sanders has previously stated that he doesn't believe his tax policy would exceed a 90 percent top bracket rate.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"CBS This Morning\" in September, Sanders explained his plan to ask the wealthiest individuals and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes. When asked about specific rates for the highest income bracket, he stated that he doesn't think it needs to reach 90 percent.\n\nHowever, Sanders has advocated for greater increases in capital gains taxes, which were capped at 25 percent during most of Eisenhower's presidency.\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also defended taxing the wealthy at a higher rate during the debate. He pointed out that in Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal tax rate was 70 percent, further supporting the idea of asking the wealthy to contribute more.\n\nOverall, Sanders' statement about not being as socialist as Eisenhower is supported by historical tax rates, although he has yet to provide an exact tax rate for the highest income bracket.",

        "text": "The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.\n\nBut not even John Podesta’s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump from the lashing that was coming his way.\n\nRepublicans lined up to criticize Trump’s language and attitudes toward women. His advisors worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisors urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump’s Sunday night debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.\n\nTrump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans’ freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. “These words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,” Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.\n\nThen, against allies’ advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s marriage. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,” Trump said.\n\nIt wasn’t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. “Donald Trump needs to humble himself,” Trump advisor Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States utter some of Trump’s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. “There have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,” Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: “How does any woman work for Donald Trump?”\n\nIt made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America’s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department’s release of more of Clinton’s own emails from her time as the nation’s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump’s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.\n\nAs Trump’s candidacy appeared—yet again—to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta’s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton’s emails, which he called an “October Surprise” on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump’s words, however. “Women have the power to stop Trump,” Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.\n\nIn an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events—and the responses—would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say “When you’re a star, they let you do it” hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.\n\n“He is talking about sexual assault. There’s no other way to frame this,” Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.\n\nFor Clinton, her top aide’s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches—a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton’s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn’t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa’s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? “Clinton admits she is out of touch,” “Clinton suggests she is a moderate” and “Clinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.”\n\nAnother potential pickle is this headline: “Clinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.” Republicans are obsessed with Clinton’s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump’s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.\n\nYet, as a whole, Trump’s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call “locker-room banter” laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women’s appearance in crass terms, and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that “such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world.” Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois called Trump “a malignant clown.” Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks “totally inappropriate and offensive.” Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said “America deserves far better” than Trump. Trump’s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination, Jeb Bush, said “no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.”\n\nTrump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump’s video. “They did their opposition research. This is what they had,” former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. “She has to change the narrative.” Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump’s supporters firmly in their camp. “A 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of concerns,” he said.\n\nThat thinking might help some of Trump’s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman’s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.\n\nBut there’s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night’s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.",

The President stressed the importance of providing support to working families and strengthening the economy during these challenging times.\n\nDuring his speech, President Obama highlighted the economic struggles faced by many Americans over the past decade, including job losses, stagnant wages, and rising costs of education and healthcare. He emphasized that the American Dream of hard work leading to success was slipping away for many people and called for renewed efforts to rebuild the economy.\n\nPresident Obama outlined his American Jobs Act, a comprehensive jobs bill aimed at creating more employment opportunities and putting more money in the pockets of working families. The bill received bipartisan support and was backed by independent economists who projected it could create up to 2 million jobs and boost the economy by as much as 2 percent.\n\nHowever, the President expressed disappointment in the Senate's refusal to debate the bill and the lack of support from Republicans. He called on Congress to reconsider and vote in favor of the American Jobs Act, specifically highlighting the need to extend tax cuts for middle-class families.\n\nThe President stressed the importance of extending the payroll tax cut, set to expire at the end of the year. He explained that failing to extend this tax cut would result in a $1,000 increase in taxes for the average middle-class family, which would also have a detrimental impact on the economy as it continues to recover from the recession.\n\nPresident Obama urged Congress to prioritize the needs of working families over protecting tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. He reiterated his belief in the collective responsibility Americans have in supporting and uplifting one another. Asking the wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share, he argued, would help create a more balanced and prosperous society.\n\nThe President called on the American people to voice their support for the extension of tax cuts to their senators, emphasizing the power of individual voices in shaping government actions. He urged Congress to put partisanship aside and work together to pass the American Jobs Act, emphasizing that America's best days lie ahead when its citizens unite in pursuit of progress.\n\nPresident Obama concluded his speech by reminding the audience that America has always risen to the occasion during challenging times and expressed his confidence in the resilience and determination of the American people.",

He mentioned that Ford, in particular, had not only survived but thrived, creating thousands of new jobs.\n\nThe President commended the partnership between labor and management in the auto industry, emphasizing that shared sacrifice and responsibility were key to its success. He noted that Ford had rejected the false choice of prioritizing shareholders over workers and had managed to benefit both parties. President Obama reaffirmed his belief that America is at its best when everyone is working together for the greater good.\n\nThe President then discussed the positive impact of the auto industry's recovery on the middle class. He stated that the industry's resurgence proved that any comeback is possible and that American manufacturing has a future. He acknowledged the challenges that both Detroit and the industry still face but expressed confidence in their ability to overcome those obstacles.\n\nBefore concluding the speech, President Obama shared the inspiring story of a veteran named Ramone, who found employment at Ford after struggling to secure a job upon returning from military service. The President used Ramone's story as an example of the American spirit of resilience and determination.\n\nIn his final remarks, President Obama reassured the audience that he would continue to support the revival of American industries and the middle class. He expressed his commitment to working alongside the hardworking men and women of the auto industry to ensure a prosperous future for America.\n\nThe President's visit to the Michigan Assembly Plant highlights the remarkable recovery of the American auto industry and serves as a testament to the hard work and dedication of its workers.",

However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House.

CloseThe “War on Christmas” catchphrase was coined by former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, who claimed in 2004 that Christmas was “under siege” by “secular progressives.” It was triggered when the department store Macy’s decided not to greet customers with “Merry Christmas” but to wish them “Happy Holidays” instead.O’Reilly seized on that as an example of an organized effort to eliminate Christian religious symbols in American public life. He and other right-wing commentators were following in the footsteps of a tradition dating back to the 1950s and the far-right John Birch Society, which claimed a communist conspiracy was hell-bent on taking “the Christ out of Christmas,” also blaming \"fantatics\" at the UN for trying to \"poison the 1959 Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda.\">>Ex-Marine who plotted San Francisco Christmas attack claims he was angry about Trump 'giving Jerusalem to the Jews'skip - Trump Christmas tweetThis is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most.

In 2011, Trump went as far as to falsely accuse then-President Barack Obama of failing to send Christmas greetings, while remembering to mark the African festival of Kwanzaa.In part of his effort to rally evangelical Christians to his camp, Trump made the issue a running theme during his 2016 presidential election campaign, repeatedly promising at his rallies that he would “bring back” the phrase “Merry Christmas.”skip - Sarah Huckabee Sanders>>The Palestinians just gave Netanyahu what he always wanted for Christmas | Analysisskip - Sanders reaction 1No one else find it oddly concerning at WH press conference today Sarah Sanders started with bringing up Christmas as “ birth of our savior “.....not all Americans would agree that this was appropriate place to discuss her religion — Karen Delaney (@KarenDelaney9) December 7, 2017skip - Sanders reaction 2@PressSec The stories of giving & of stepping up were inspirational, as you intended.

That I can tell you.”In his 2016 post-election victory lap around the country, his travels were officially dubbed the “Merry Christmas USA 2016 Victory Tour.” A year later, at a rally in Pensacola, Florida, “Merry Christmas” was front and center once again.skip - Daniel Shapiro tweetLove that Trump’s proclamation on Jerusalem is dated 2017 “in the year of our Lord”.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of evangelical leader and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, invoked Christian belief during her briefing on December 7, with a tale designed to “shine a spotlight” on seasonal “generosity.” She related the story of St. Matthew’s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia, which follows a century-old tradition of helping families who can’t afford Christmas toys for their children. While Sanders’ story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian. She said that such “stories are important because they remind us what this season is all about and that’s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.”Sanders’ message raised eyebrows and comment on social media.skip - Ivanka Trump tweetAnother small but significant sign of change was spotted by former White House aide and former ambassador to Israel Daniel B.

But the tradition of holding a Hanukkah celebration only began during the second Bush administration, so Trump presumably could have gotten away with eliminating it – though that might not have sat well with daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.Indeed, Ivanka Trump’s Twitter feed was one of the clearest indicators that the “return to Merry Christmas” message had not penetrated the culture very deeply.She seemed to quite deliberately choose to wish her five million Twitter followers “Happy Holidays!” with no mention of the “C-word,” in what some viewed as outright defiance of her father’s “War on Christmas” rhetoric.For those who would chalk up Ivanka’s Christmas-less greeting to the fact she is Jewish, there was further evidence of the cultural zeitgeist with the fact her younger brother Eric also stayed ecumenical in wishing the best from Trump Winery.Even Melania Trump’s much publicized – and much maligned – choices for decorating the White House felt more pagan than overtly Christian, with many white branches and relatively few representations of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. Yes, there was a crèche display in the White House, but there had been one throughout the Obama administration, despite false rumors to the contrary.All of this demonstrates the fact that while Trump’s enthusiastic crusade against what he characterizes as a nefarious anti-“Merry Christmas” and pro-“Happy Holidays” conspiracy may play well with his base, his obsession with the issue isn’t at all reflective of mainstream America.That feeling is born out with a newly released Pew Research Center survey, which found that far fewer Americans care about being explicitly wished a “Merry Christmas” than they had in the past.The Pew poll reported: “A rising share of Americans say they do not have a preference about how they are greeted in stores during the holiday season, while a declining percentage prefer to have stores greet them with ‘Merry Christmas.’”skip - Politicization of ChristmasI now no longer know if people wishing me a Merry Christmas want me to have a merry Christmas or fashion themselves aggressive foot soldiers in what they perceive to be the War on Christmas. — Keith Phipps (@kphipps3000) December 23, 2017According to the survey, Americans were previously split down the middle when it came to expressing a preference for “Merry Christmas” over an alternative greeting when they were asked about it more than a decade ago and again in 2012.skip - Feraz Ozel tweet‘My Muslim family has been happy to say Merry Christmas’ — Comedian Feraz Ozel is proving once and for all that the ‘War on Christmas’ doesn’t actually exist pic.twitter.com/Se6dEVvQxJ — NowThis (@nowthisnews) December 22, 2017This year, more than half of the U.S. public surveyed, 52 percent, told pollsters that a business’ choice of holiday greeting did not matter to them, while just a third – 32 percent – said they preferred that stores and businesses greet customers with “Merry Christmas” during the holidays.Overall, the Pew survey pointed to the fact that Trump’s election does not reflect a surge in Christian religiosity in America. In fact, it found the religious aspects of Christmas were markedly “declining.”The number of Americans who believe that the “biblical account of the birth of Jesus depicts actual events” is “shrinking,” it said, and “a declining majority says religious displays such as nativity scenes should be allowed on government property.It’s nothing new for Trump to appeal to his core base, and presumably his “War on Christmas” obsession shores up his status with evangelicals – even as it flies in the face of the sentiments of the majority of Americans, who seem happy to celebrate any holiday and don’t care much how it’s expressed. For many, the politicization of what is supposed to be a greeting of seasonal cheer is simply confusing.In a blow to the “War on Christmas” theory from one of Trump’s least favorite religious minorities, comedian Feraz Ozel compiled video of Muslim-American families wishing their countrymen a Merry Christmas in order to demonstrate that non-Christians were just fine with the phrase.“Plenty of Muslims and brown folks from different religions are still happy to wish you a ‘Merry Christmas’ if the time is right,” Ozel said. “Just because some people say ‘Happy Holidays’ to people who don’t celebrate it doesn’t mean that we’re not happy to wish you a very Merry Christmas also.”",

A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,\" Rowlinson said. \"You wouldn't get this from any other guy,\" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites.

Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",

Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.",

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.Congresswoman and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on December 19, 2015. Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty Images\"Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,\" Damron said in a emailed statement.Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a \"riskier\" forms of collateral, according to court documents.However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a \"high-intensity supervision program,\" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman.Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.A hearing is slated for August 21.Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and \"began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.\"\"For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,\" Gowen said in an emailed statement.\"Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter.

Photograph: Albemarle County Jail/AFP/Getty Images“He has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,” Kumer said in an email.Donald Trump condemned the “violence on many sides”, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville.State police said in a statement the helicopter was “assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation” when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – videoCharlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read moreThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.”Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will – go home.”Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: “Go home … Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.NBC News (@NBCNews) WATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally https://t.co/4qH1yJjrGyThe car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said: “We’re here to counteract white supremacy, and to let people know that it is a system of evil and a system of sin.”Steve Thomas, from Lynchburg, Virginia, who also protested against the far-right groups, said: “I think that what we are witnessing here has always been simmering beneath the surface, and now has been emboldened and enabled by the Trump administration’s politics and rhetoric.”Statue controversyIn February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.It was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by about 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan’s departure, and made 23 arrests.Ben Jacobs and the Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "text": "Facebook Twitter Reddit EmailHurricane Irma has become even stronger than the most extreme forecasts were projecting. According to the National Hurricane Center, Irma had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour at one point on Tuesday. That makes it the strongest Atlantic hurricane in history “outside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean”. I was criticized for suggesting that Irma could become so powerful that it could potentially be labeled a “category 6” storm if such a thing existed. Well, now it has actually happened. If you extrapolate the Saffir-Simpson scale, “category 6” would begin at 158 knots, which would be 181.8 miles per hour. Since Irma has surpassed that mark, I believe that it is entirely reasonable if people want to refer to it as a “category 6” storm.Of course some meteorologists will get very heated with you when you use the term “category 6” because no such category exists at this point.But we need some way to describe an Atlantic hurricane with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour. “Category 5” simply does not do such a storm justice, and yes, Hurricane Irma is the type of storm that could wipe entire cities off the map if it came ashore at this power.We don’t know where this immensely powerful storm will make landfall in the U.S. yet, but you don’t want to be there when it does. I don’t want to freak people out, but the truth is that the best thing you can do is to get as far away from this storm as you can.Just remember what happened in Houston. The people were told not to evacuate, and that turned out to be an absolutely disastrous decision.This is not just another storm. This is a history making event, and if Irma slams directly into one of our major cities as a category 5 storm, it could potentially make Hurricane Harvey look like a Sunday picnic. The following are some of the key things that you need to know about Hurricane Irma…#1 According to the Miami Herald, Hurricane Irma had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour on Tuesday afternoon…Irma continued to explode into a powerful storm Tuesday afternoon, with winds increasing to 185 mph, National Hurricane Center forecasters said in a 2 p.m. advisory. As the storm continued to track westward, islands in its path raced to complete last minute preparations. The Leeward Islands are expected to get hit with “catastrophic” winds tonight, forecasters said, with the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico slammed tomorrow. In Puerto Rico, the governor asked President Donald Trump to declare a state of emergency, while the electric company warned Irma’s fierce winds could leave the island without power for four to six months.#2 The NOAA is saying that Irma is “the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic — outside the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico.”#3 As mentioned above, if you extrapolate the Saffir-Simpson scale, Irma could be considered a category 6 storm…While few are willing to admit it yet, according to meteorologist Ryan Maye, Hurricane Irma is still intensifying, with winds up to 155-knots (180 mph) and that extrapolating Saffir-Simpson scale, 158-knots would be Category 6.Yes, I know that a “category 6” does not exist yet, but perhaps it is about time that scientists got together and updated the scale in light of the dangerous new realities that we are now facing.#4 Hurricane Irma is so enormously powerful that it is even “showing up on seismometers”…Hurricane Irma is so strong it’s showing up on seismometers — equipment designed to measure earthquakes. “What we’re seeing in the seismogram are low-pitched hums that gradually become stronger as the hurricane gets closer to the seismometer on the island of Guadeloupe,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom.#5 In all of U.S. history, only three category 5 hurricanes have ever hit the United States – an unnamed storm in 1935, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992.#6 A state of emergency has already been declared for every single county in the state of Florida.#7 If you are in the “danger zone” and you have not already stockpiled food, water and supplies, it is probably already too late. Reports of “panic prepping” are coming in from all over Florida, and down in Puerto Rico many stores are already out of all the most important supplies…On Tuesday, the lines for fast-dwindling gas, food, water and hardware were interminable and anxiety mounted. One hardware store in San Juan had been nearly picked clean by afternoon. “This has been like this for the last three days,” said Juan Carlos Ramirez, the store manager. “We’ve sold all of the most necessary items — flashlight, batteries, plywood.”One of my readers made the point the other day that this isn’t the kind of storm that you can “prepare” for.And my reader was precisely correct. You can’t “get prepared” for a hurricane with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour. Such a storm will snap homes like toothpicks.If I was in Florida, I would be heading north immediately. Those that wait could find themselves in absolutely nightmarish traffic jams.And if I lived on the Gulf coast, I would be watching this storm very, very carefully.Because the waters in the Gulf of Mexico are so warm, there is the possibility that Irma could get even stronger if it slides to the south of Florida.Let us hope that it does not happen, but a scenario in which Irma makes landfall along the Gulf coast as a category 5 storm would probably be the worst of all potential possibilities.If such a scenario plays out, please get out of the path of this storm. Trying to “ride this storm out” would do you no good whatsoever.Michael Snyder is a Republican candidate for Congress in Idaho’s First Congressional District, and you can learn how you can get involved in the campaign on his official website.

        "text": "Washington (CNN) Former national security adviser Susan Rice privately told House investigators that she unmasked the identities of senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York late last year, multiple sources told CNN.The New York meeting preceded a separate effort by the UAE to facilitate a back-channel communication between Russia and the incoming Trump White House.The crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, arrived in New York last December in the transition period before Trump was sworn into office for a meeting with several top Trump officials, including Michael Flynn, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his top strategist Steve Bannon, sources said.The Obama administration felt misled by the United Arab Emirates, which had failed to mention that Zayed was coming to the United States even though it's customary for foreign dignitaries to notify the US government about their travels, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Rice, who served as then-President Obama's national security adviser in his second term, told the House Intelligence Committee last week that she requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally, a practice officials in both parties say is common.Rice's previously undisclosed revelation in a classified setting shines new light on a practice that had come under sharp criticism from the committee chairman, California Rep. Devin Nunes, and President Donald Trump, who previously accused Rice of committing a crimeBut her explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump and raising new questions about whether any Trump associates tried to arrange back-channel discussions with the Russians.\"I didn't hear anything to believe that she did anything illegal,\" Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican helping to lead the panel's Russia invesigation, told CNN of Rice's testimony. He declined to discuss any of the contents of her classified remarks.Through a spokeswoman, Rice declined to comment about her testimony. Nunes refused to answer questions when asked about Rice Tuesday evening.It's unclear precisely which Trump officials Rice discussed at the House meeting. But multiple sources have confirmed to CNN that Zayed met at the time with Flynn, Kushner and Bannon. The three-hour discussion focused on a range of issues, including Iran, Yemen and the Mideast peace process, according to two sources who insisted that opening up a back-channel with Russia was not a topic of discussion.Still, the fact that the New York meeting occurred prior to the Seychelles session and that the UAE did not notify the Obama administration about why the crown prince was coming to the United States has raised questions in the eyes of investigators on Capitol Hill.A secret meeting in the SeychellesBut the Trump Tower meeting came shortly before the UAE brokered a meeting to open lines of communications with the United States and Russia, with a clandestine January meeting in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, according to reports in CNN and The Washington Post. That meeting is now under investigation on Capitol Hill, though it's unclear whether Rice mentioned the Seychelles meeting in the testimony.A senior Middle East official told CNN that the UAE did not \"mislead\" the Obama administration about the crown prince's visit, but acknowledged not telling the US government about it in advance. The meeting, which took place December 15, 2016, the official said, was simply an effort to build a relationship with senior members of the Trump team who would be working in the administration to share assessments of the region.\"The meeting was about ascertaining the Trump team's view of the region and sharing the UAE's view of the region and what the US role should be,\" the official said. \"No one was coming in to sell anything or arrange anything.\"A spokesperson for the crown prince declined to comment.The Seychelles meeting -- and the circumstances around it -- has been a subject of interest to Hill investigators looking at any potential link between the Trump campaign and Russia.The Washington Post initially reported in April that the UAE brokered a pre-inauguration meeting between the founder of the security firm Blackwater, Erik Prince, who is a close Trump ally, and an associate of Vladimir Putin's in the Seychelles Islands. The purpose of the meeting was part of an effort by the UAE to persuade Russia to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, according to the Post.And it occured shortly after Bannon, Flynn and Kushner also met in Trump Tower with Zayed, whom the Post said helped arrange the Seychelles meeting with Russia government officials to set up the private discussions with the Trump team.But the senior Middle East official told CNN this week that Prince's name was not discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. And Prince himself has said he did nothing wrong, telling CNN's Erin Burnett last month: \"I was there for business.\"Both the White House and Prince have strongly denied that Prince was working as a liaison for the Trump administration.Prince said he met with a Russian while at the Seychelles but \"I don't remember his name.\"\"It probably lasted about, as long as one beer,\" he said about the meeting.Explaining 'unmasking'For her part, Rice had been called to the House Intelligence Committee to testify partly over what Nunes and other Republicans believed was an abuse in the practice of \"unmasking\" -- or revealing the identities of Americans who were communicating with foreign officials under surveillance by the US intelligence community. Simply unmasking the names of individuals in classified reports does not mean that their identities will be revealed publicly, and Rice denied to the committee that she leaked classified information to the press, sources familiar with the matter said.But Rice's suggestion that she unmasked the names of US individuals -- who turned out to be Trump associates -- over concerns about the propriety of the crown prince's visit to the United States could help her fend off attacks that she was out of line in the actions she took.Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who is helping lead the House investigation, told the Daily Caller \"nothing that came up in her interview that led me to conclude\" that she improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates or leaked it to the press.Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, did not say explicitly whether Trump still believes Rice committed a crime but added the issue of leaking and unmasking needs to be investigated.\"We've seen illegal leaking of classified materials, including the identities of American citizens unmasked in intelligence reports,\" Sanders told CNN. \"That's why the President called for Congress to investigate this matter and why the Department of Justice and Intelligence Community are doing all they can to stamp out this dangerous trend that undermines our national security.\"Nunes was forced to step aside from running the Russia investigation amid a House ethics inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified data. The ethics inquiry came in the aftermath of his bombshell comments that Obama administration officials had improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates, a revelation that Trump used as cover for his unsubstantiated claim that Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped during the election to spy on him. The Justice Department said in a court filing Friday that the DOJ and the FBI have no evidence to support Trump's claims.But on Tuesday, the Republican who took over the investigation from Nunes said there was no reason to bring Rice in for further questioning.\"She was a good witness, answered all our questions,\" Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican now running the House Russia probe, told CNN. \"I'm not aware of any reason to bring her back.\"",

        "text": "Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBill Clinton's novel sees fastest fiction sales in two years From Singapore, skepticism and hope The Memo: Summit gives Trump political boost — with risks MORE’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSessions defends firing Comey, warns DOJ report could prompt more terminations Sanders gets best reception at early 2020 audition Hillicon Valley: DHS gets new cyber chief | White House warns lawmakers not to block ZTE deal | White nationalists find home on Google Plus | Comcast outbids Disney for Fox | Anticipation builds for report on FBI Clinton probe MORE served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.ADVERTISEMENTRather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderHolder redistricting group backs lawsuits for 3 additional majority-black congressional districts Liberal groups launches ads against prospective Trump Supreme Court nominees Ready for somebody? Dems lack heir apparent this time MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a “racketeering scheme” that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.“As part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,” Agent David Gadren testified.“Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,” the agent added.The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump Donald John TrumpAvenatti: 'I think that Michael Cohen is in a very, very bad spot' MSNBC reporter: Detained immigrant children 'effectively incarcerated' in Texas facility GOP chairwoman: Anyone who doesn't support Trump 'will be making a mistake' MORE’s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired earlier this year.Its many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.The case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia’s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.One of Mikerin’s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency’s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.By that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’s approval.The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, “a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison” and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin’s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.“I had no idea this case was being conducted,” a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.Former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal.“Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,” he said. “The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.”This story was updated at 6:50 p.m.Indictment Affidavit by M Mali on ScribdWarrant Affidavit by M Mali on ScribdMikerin Plea Deal by M Mali on Scribd",

Bayer suggests that one way to help people quit would be by tackling the problem from the supply side. “I think we would do much better to think about reducing the nicotine content, so that the addictive quality of cigarettes wasn’t as severe, and make quitting easier.” The World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control established a method called MPOWER in 2008 that aims to end the “global tobacco epidemic,” which kills over 7 million people each year. The way to do this is not by banning it all at once, but instead by monitoring use and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke, offering ways to help people quit, warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.If you like this blog don't forget to share it.You are currently reading about Smoking In Cars With Children Is Illegal Starting January 30, 2018.

        "text": "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",

Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.“Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.Conservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.“You will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?” Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.Abby Ohlheiser contributed to this report, which has been updated.Read more:Rep.

Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.\"Andrea Bocelli(Getty)In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.Ice TAn odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.I just got call to perform at the Inauguration…. I didn’t pick up and Blocked the number. — ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) December 16, 2016He wrote on Twitter: \"I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.\"Celine DionAccording to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.John LegendJohn Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: \"Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.\"We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\"Adam LambertAdam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.\"I don't think I would take money on that one,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.\"The Dixie ChicksSpeaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. \"No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,\" he said.\"If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.\"",

        "text": "USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionYou might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com",

In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.",

They really beat him. It's appalling — like something you would see in a war zone,\" she said.“He looks terrible,\" she continues.\"His left eye is like a golf ball and bleeding, the nose looks like it could be broken.“He hasn’t had an x-ray yet.\"He doesn’t remember anything.\"The first thing he remembers is the police.“He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.“Nothing was taken, but the transport police intervened quickly.\"London is such a beautiful, wonderful city.\"We can't start worrying about walking in the streets at 3 pm.\"© press The 74-year-old retired diplomat, pictured with his wife, was beaten to a pulp for his political viewDaily Mail reports: Cambridge-educated Sir Christopher worked as press secretary for former chancellor Geoffrey Howe and John Major before being appointed US ambassador.He spent six years in Washington, from 1997 to 2003, becoming the longest-serving holder of his office since 1945.As ambassador, he welcomed around 35,000 guests to his home a year and was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.After retiring, he became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the former newspaper regulatory body.He is a prolific tweeter, who regularly comments on politics and foreign affairs.The former diplomat has called for Britain to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit today.He has been married to Catherine for more than 20 years.Sir Christopher's attack comes as London's crime rate has soared.Since the start of the year, more than 80 murder investigations have been launched in the capital.Forces in England and Wales logged 5.3million crimes in the year to September 2017, 14 percent up on the previous 12 months.A statement from the British Transport Police (BTP) said:\"Officers were called to Victoria London Underground Station at 2.45pm yesterday (11 July), after receiving reports that a man had been seriously assaulted.\"A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon were both arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm.\"They have been released under investigation while inquiries into the incident continue.\"A man in his seventies was taken to hospital, though his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or changing.\"Thoughts with former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, who was brutally attacked yesterday.
